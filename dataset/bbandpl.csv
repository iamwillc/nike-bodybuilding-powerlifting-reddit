bodybuilding,Lmao so classic is basically open now
bodybuilding,"No one had a coach up until late 90s. Seems like they did fine without.

When you look at the ""protocols"" some people coached by ""top level coaches"" published, it's obvious that coaches are amazing at over complicating things (to make themselves appear more relevant than they really are) and throwing kitchen sink of drugs at everyone. Some are also additionally great at self promotion and picking people who are simply destined to be winners (either because obviously great genetics or having won prior)."
bodybuilding,Let‚Äôs all agree with enough and some. 1st place is money üí¥ bb.
bodybuilding,58 now 59 at Christmas
bodybuilding,Where is the cheapest iso100 fruity pebbles? Idk a website to check
bodybuilding,I can't believe i did not know he is 27 years old.
bodybuilding,"awesome, great progress for 18 months would love to see a before pic and one after sarms before your first test blast"
bodybuilding,Isn't that why Steve Cook stopped competing? The stress and brutality of cutting to super low BF% just doesn't seem worth it when you're already pulling in bank from social media and other sponsorships.
bodybuilding,Nice calves
bodybuilding,"If I am a regular guy, training five days a week for general fitness but want to start moving into bodybuilding-specific training, where do I start?  Any recommendations for where a total noob to BB should start?"
bodybuilding,"Terrence was debatably better than Chris last year and is far and away the best poser in bodybuilding currently. Wouldn‚Äôt say Chris winning is set in stone, especially when you look at how much the gap narrowed last year compared to 2020 when he blew everyone out of the water."
bodybuilding,this had me rolling dude XD
bodybuilding,That fst 7 is really something lol
bodybuilding,Fantastic job üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
bodybuilding,"It makes it easier to have someone just tell you exactly what to do, be objective, and push you/motivate you.

That said, I just did my first show (regional) and felt I came in really well considering I didn't have a coach."
bodybuilding,Chris won‚Äôt take open pros level of drugs but he takes a fair amount. If I had to guess I‚Äôd say Bumstead is being truthful when he says he‚Äôs on 200-300 mg test in the off season but he 100% turns it up in the show season .. my guess is Bumstead takes a minimum of 1-1.5 grams of gear per week and thays being very generous considering ronnie said during his peak open pros we‚Äôre taking 3-5-5 grams of gear per week
bodybuilding,"Dude I would have your shoulder and arms! I hope you could post your routine or Tips for it

Keep posting"
bodybuilding,"Incredible.


Age?"
bodybuilding,Time to cut that 5 pounds or do you wait till the last week?
bodybuilding,So one person did it without a coach and thats your proof? Meanwhile dozens upon dozens of top pros have coaches but it‚Äôs a scam? Ok lol
bodybuilding,You look way bigger than 5 7 god damn
bodybuilding,I hope Hany can figure out his body fairly quick. Check out Fuads bro chat. Lee Priest says Hany is a big proponent of drugs. Chris won‚Äôt do that with a compromised system.
bodybuilding,Would you care to donate some arm mass to the needy
bodybuilding,Well done for all your hard work!!! Definitely worth it üòÅ
bodybuilding,"Dorian won ‚Äútop shows‚Äù without a coach. I won a show without a coach. No, it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äútop show‚Äù, but I did show up in condition. 

Religion is a scam, but it doesn‚Äôt prevent tons of people from believing in it."
bodybuilding,"Man this sub is full of casuals that probably don't even train or know shit about BB, there's a lot and I mean a LOT of amazing athletes coming into this show with ridiculous improvements this year, if u guys think Cbum is some sort of unbeatable god u be very disappointed by the reality this year."
bodybuilding,"Sure, but so is a lot of other things. Unless you can quantify the risk using data, you don‚Äôt really have any idea about relative risk compared to, say, binge drinking every weekend or recreational drug usage. Or even eating processed meat."
bodybuilding,"The first pic, about 10 years. Ha. The second and third are day after and day of, in that order."
bodybuilding,"Considering literally every top pro has a coach I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúscam‚Äù let‚Äôs see you win top shows with no coach to push you during your workouts, give you your drug protocol, peak you for the show, make you‚Äôre on point etc."
bodybuilding,I misread that as ‚ÄúHaney‚Äù and got utterly confused and excited at the same time.
bodybuilding,True I missed the then ‚Ä¶.
bodybuilding,Nah but I think Nick Walker might be
bodybuilding,"The ‚Äúthen‚Äù at the end of his scented eye strongly implied that is what he meant. If you read his responses to my educated guess there, you‚Äôll see that is indeed what he was implying.

It doesn‚Äôt take a ‚Äúbig brain‚Äù to interpret language like that."
bodybuilding,How many weeks out
bodybuilding,r/lostredditors
bodybuilding,"Has nothing to do with what competitors are paying. It has to do with what brings viewers. People want to see the biggest, most muscular people on Earth, and women ain't it."
bodybuilding,Coaching is such a scam. Am I the only one who find this whole obsession with coaches completely insufferable? I‚Äôm not even mentioning the ridiculous self promotion aspect of it.
bodybuilding,God shit bro!
bodybuilding,people really think someone‚Äôs beating him?üòÇ
bodybuilding,Really depends on the PED tho doesnt it? Some of them deff wont really fuck with your organs or joints.
bodybuilding,He asked how leg workouts differ that‚Äôs it. He didn‚Äôt say anything about that being reason they have different builds lol.
bodybuilding,"Wanna see that double biceps now, kinda curious how much he has progressed. When I saw the back last year compared to the year before I was like ""this is witch craft""."
bodybuilding,Holy freaking forearms Batman
bodybuilding,I always like when dudes drop crazy physique pics in here and are humble in the comments. You look insane man.
bodybuilding,My opinion: Chris is undercover for Matt Jansen!
bodybuilding,Well coaching isnt shit for guys like pulumbo. They sit on their ass and hand out 4 cookie cutter protocals to all of their clients. Of course he wouldnt understand why a competiter would have difficulty coaching another competiter.
bodybuilding,Sorry what? Dude absolutely looks like a freak. A beautiful enormous freak
bodybuilding,Calfs and forearms are pretty much genetics when it comes to bodybuilding. The two muscles are used daily and you would literally have to train them above bodybuilding criteria to get the results most would want. Calf for example carry your body weight all day and people really think loading a calf machine and doing 8-10 reps will really stimulate them? However most strongmen have huge calves and forearms because they‚Äôre basically using those muscle groups in high repetitions and heavy ass weight. Also people never make the correlation that fatter people who‚Äôs used to walking a lot have huge calf‚Äôs after they‚Äôve lost the weight.
bodybuilding,"No, but she was trying to get her IFBB card but then realized she could grift in other ways"
bodybuilding,"ZERO. I built my Homegym exclusively for this reason alone. My workout partners and I bullshit a little and have fun don‚Äôt get me wrong but the lifts are freaking intense, focused and on point."
bodybuilding,Search my name. It's in here
bodybuilding,They're in here.
bodybuilding,Doesn't really fit the sub without the competition pic
bodybuilding,Might of been a bit more impactful with  an after picture
bodybuilding,"She's on this sub too so we share posts pretty often. 
Can't pretend like there aren't good looking people out there, just gotta make sure when the day ends I'm tryna be one of them! 
I have massive body dismorphia so this comment made me actually Laugh out loud. 
No, no confidence to speak of. Hahaha"
bodybuilding,"Can anyone give me advice on choosing or making a program?  
so early on when I just started going to the gym I followed this program called GZCLP for a good year. But now i'm kind of looking to target some specific muscles which I think I'm lacking on (delts, lats, chest). Does this program I created look good? I do want to follow a program but I'm not sure how to find one that will target what i'm lagging behind on  
The idea behind this is since i'm aiming to go every other day, in a week I'm aiming to hit 10-15 sets for each muscle group, with each exercise ranging from 8-15 reps.  
Workout A: Incline bench, Flat bench (or some other chest exercise), Rows, lateral raises

Workout B: Squats, Hip thrust, Rows, lateral raised"
bodybuilding,She didn‚Äôt pose nude?
bodybuilding,Well stated! The IFBB makes money for a select few in a group that is drunk with power.
bodybuilding,Yes sir
bodybuilding,sending pictures to your wife of a half naked man that you aspire to be like. you must have supreme levels of confidence
bodybuilding,No one's upset haha :) I think it was auto immune disease also...?

bodybuilding,you can't call someone a bitch when you eat sub 2000 calories a day bro lol
bodybuilding,What did it say all the posts got deleted....
bodybuilding,"You can add a lot of size quickly yes, but there‚Äôs an obvious difference in muscle maturity that judges notice. Chris‚Äôs second year he put on a lot of size to his back but you could tell next to Breon or George (RIP) that it wasn‚Äôt on the same level."
bodybuilding,looking bonkers.  Whats the stack like/how long you been on?
bodybuilding,Poor Paige Hathaway couldn‚Äôt get an IFBB card
bodybuilding,Looking solid bro
bodybuilding,"Reminds me of Mike Mentzer, everything is proportional"
bodybuilding,Next you‚Äôre gonna tell me The Rock is on steroids‚Ä¶
bodybuilding,We should talk routine 172 and need that physic!!!
bodybuilding,I hated what Palumbo-ism said about the situation. Saying it‚Äôs BS blah blah trying to make it seem like it might be deeper. Really downplayed how much effort coaching takes. And I‚Äôm sitting there like‚Ä¶ bro literally 3/4 of y‚Äôall morons on this podcast are COACHES. and here you are downplaying your jobs. Of course there is stress when you‚Äôre prepping someone who has won the O 3x lol‚Ä¶ and having to worry about your own prep.
bodybuilding,"You're more than likely just joking but I don't know with people anymore so I'll answer, no"
bodybuilding,"u/marissaminibeast"
bodybuilding,"&gt;ah yes, do body weight exercises that you can't progressively overload past a certain point

Just buy a belt you can attach weight to, bitch."
bodybuilding,what about ramy?
bodybuilding,What excircises do you still avoid if you don't mind me asking? / What are some good alternatives you've found work well?
bodybuilding,"He‚Äôs not a popular figure here in Germany - he was in charge of the Love Parade, an electric music festival that was so poorly planned that 21 lost their lives when panic broke out. 

But he‚Äôs still to young to die."
bodybuilding,I thought this was the natural division?
bodybuilding,Idk how many compounds Chris is adding
bodybuilding,....clearly you know what you're talking about
bodybuilding,They confirmed it on YouTube on Chris channel is where I saw it
bodybuilding,"I go to a very social gym. Mostly because all of the bigger guys/guys that visibly look like they lift have been going there for years so we've all been friends for at least 5+ years now and we're all pretty close, so if a lot of us are there there's a good bit of chit chatting and ball busting going on"
bodybuilding,From his last insta updates it didn't really look like he was prepping.
bodybuilding,"Talking about it as a community and spreading awareness seems to be the first step in the right direction. Similar to what we did with natty status. 
In a time where everything is overly sexualized we should reaffirm the fact that this sport is about showcasing great accomplishment, not being eye candy for perverts. 
Females that have been subjected to this form of degenerate behavior should know that it is safe for them to speak up. Apes together strong"
bodybuilding,"Without a single doubt...I don't know why everyone keeps parroting ""145"" like it means anything.  If it makes you feel better I guess keep telling people he's 145."
bodybuilding,So is being a runaway model or in an actual beauty pageant lol
bodybuilding,Aspirational for someone who is also 6'2 üôèüèΩ
bodybuilding,Golf is a sport and yet you don‚Äôt need ‚Äúathleticism‚Äù as you are describing it to play.
bodybuilding,"Kinda got a Zane vibe. 

Look ridiculous"
bodybuilding,Bodybuilders are not athletic. Most of them can‚Äôt even wipe their own asses.
bodybuilding,I don't think it was speculation. Didn't they confirm it first hand on BB and BS from Ian?

bodybuilding,What exercise do you do to train your forearms?
bodybuilding,"Article states its ""pay to win"" but their example ""paid"" (i.e. consented to adult pictures) and ended up in last place. Their first place example didnt do adult photos and won...This is pretty sad ""journalism"" even for WAPO"

bodybuilding,oh shit here comes another 8 ‚≠ïÔ∏è‚Äòs for hany
bodybuilding,"Hey guys, I need desperate help, my shoulder during bench and squat are uneven, my neck is tilted to the right, I went 4 times to osteopath and 3 times to fisioterapist. I have no changes. My neck is tilted to the right too! 3 months ago I had nothing, if someone can help it would be really appreciated!!"
bodybuilding,I thought the Buendia allegations were proven fake?
bodybuilding,And then you will wake up?
bodybuilding,"Completely depends on the people around me.  At most gyms, I try to keep to myself.  Generally will have one person, on average, approach me to talk to me or ask me something.  

I've lifted at 3 gyms where I had more of a community.  One was a very small private gym were we all got to know each other pretty well.  Another was a large commercial gym that just had an amazing atmosphere.  Everyone was super cool, but I can't explain why or how that happened.  The final gym is if I'm lifting at work."
bodybuilding,I feel like he will come off and someone else will come in looking ridiculously improved
bodybuilding,Is this physic natty attainable for a 6‚Äô3 guy?  Looks great
bodybuilding,"Looking sick my dude. Im just gonna say if you want actual input on your physique going into classic then maybe include some classic poses, front double bi, front lat, back double bi etc. Hard to give a good assessment from just these pics but no doubt you have something sick to work with. Looking great spot for 4 weeks out."
bodybuilding,"If I‚Äôm lifting with a friend which I do about half the time, we‚Äôll chat between sets, even so it typically doesn‚Äôt affect the pace of our lifts"
bodybuilding,"Your waist absolutely thickens from powerlifting. Not enough to get a Phil Heath belly but it‚Äôs totally a thing, even for the ‚Äúlean‚Äù guys. Probably not super applicable in this case though."
bodybuilding,Don‚Äôt sports have a points system?
bodybuilding,"Since Iain is also competing, he wants to focus on his career and Chris doesn't want him to stress about coaching him. Chris said that Hany and he started officially talking in August"
bodybuilding,chill bro.. i love telling people i am technically obese and shoving my face with ice cream and they wonder why im in better shape than them
bodybuilding,"This is the gist of it, Ian wants to break into the top 6 this year, and with the current lineup that just isn't going to happen if he can't focus on himself. There's a lot of pressure prepping the reigning champion and I'm sure Chris came before Ian in Ian's mind when it was prep time. 

It makes a ton of sense"
bodybuilding,Vitruvian physique but in better lmao. Jokes appart yall look sick asf !! Great physiques
bodybuilding,"&gt; If we just discard any unusual idea just because it doesnt jive with preconceived notions, how will we ever get anywhere?

bodybuilding and growing MUSCLE has been figured out its just goofs who refuse to actually apply what has already been learned that causes disruption and bunch of mumbo jumbo

powerlifting relies on precise programming to get stronger

bodybuilding relies on **feeling** that specific muscle working, training to failure, and recovering"
bodybuilding,"I mean blow up the NPC and IFBB and start new orgs with founders that aren't huge creepos, might be a good start.

The judging is always going to be subjective, it's an aesthetics based competition, but that winners are determined by a bizarre combination of favoritism, racism, and sexual exploitation and that all of that is kind of an open secret, seems to make it pretty clear that these orgs have run their course."
bodybuilding,Biceps bigger than Hany‚Äôs head‚Ä¶goodness
bodybuilding,"I exclusively work out alone at home these days, but I‚Äòve always been focussed on lifting exclusively even back in my commercial gym days. I have a decent social circle and I‚Äòm there to get my work done and go home, so no need for conversations."
bodybuilding,Google says 2022 is his last year. So I think he's competing this year and then retiring.
bodybuilding,Surprised Pikachu face
bodybuilding,I've heard a lot of speculation that Chris and Ian split up so close to the Olympia because Ian wants to focus on his own prep. It definitely seems like an amicable split
bodybuilding,Ya I know lol we‚Äôre in agreement
bodybuilding,"I‚Äôm no expert on the oil. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referencing the oil solvent which the drug is dissolved in? But also, I think that the anabolic do have harmful effects for sure, specifically at the doses required for serious muscle growth and maintenance. As androgen agonists there are downstream or off target effects on lots of different tissue types."
bodybuilding,That's who he means yeah. Buendia worked with Hany for 6 years I believe
bodybuilding,"While there‚Äòs definately a wide range in terms of insertion within siblings (my experience), the hand position in their poses shifts the perceived length of their biceps. Just throwing that in, in case you didn‚Äòt catch it."
bodybuilding,nah you good bro. just wanted to put that out there.
bodybuilding,No need to get upset. I didn't say he should and it's his kidneys he has problems with.
bodybuilding,I didn't say he should and I know about the health issues. My bad! Touchy subject.
bodybuilding,so same old same old just as ramy in the open ?
bodybuilding,"chris will prolly retire after this olympia. his health issues will get in the way and become a hugeeee issue if he continues. plus, now he‚Äôs getting married. now time to settle down and start a family"
bodybuilding,I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 / 187cm
bodybuilding,"How social a lifter are you?

In the gym I tend to focus on purely smashing out my sets and moving onto the next excerise before I run out of time. Do you prefer to take it slower and chat?"
bodybuilding,Big compliment! Thank you
bodybuilding,Damage to his intestines and die. He's got health conditions that won't allow him to do so.
bodybuilding,Perfect proportions and everything. You could def compete in a high level
bodybuilding,I would love to see him move to Open and see what he could do. His physique reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger. I think he could do some damage.
bodybuilding,Supersets of leg extensions followed by heel raised goblet squats at the end of quad day just slaps...
bodybuilding,"I mean yeah Classic is a great move, we‚Äôll see if it turns into anything substantial. I‚Äôd love it to"
bodybuilding,"When a girl posts ""her ‚ú®confidence‚ú® is everything"" on a picture of an obese girl, she's 100% aware of how devastating her ""compliment"" is, right?"
bodybuilding,i think breon retired
bodybuilding,"ah yes, do body weight exercises that you can't progressively overload past a certain point 

/u/subjectOmega

personally id just blast the fuck out of my arms 

Chest no direct arm work

Back no direct arm work

Arms DIRECT WORK

rest

Chest+back no direct arm work

Shoulders arms

rest"
bodybuilding,"Its a joke, because obese is a medical term that is determined by BMI.

Also hany is def not obese look at him!"
bodybuilding,I think breon has a fair shot at cbum tbh because of his back but idk tbh im not a judge
bodybuilding,"I‚Äôd wager nearly every bodybuilder and their team are technically ‚Äúobese‚Äù if you go by BMI. 

(Don‚Äôt go by BMI)"
bodybuilding,"I don't think the anabolics are necessarily to blame. They don't prolong your life, that is for sure.

But I believe the oil they are using (and he clearly used a lot) create havoc by going in every tissue of the body after a while, doing much more damage than people think."
bodybuilding,5‚Äô7 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
bodybuilding,He got the nickname because he helped a lot of people get their pro card. It was before he worked with Phil Heath.
bodybuilding,"Deaam you big bro !

i guess will be more bigger!:DNice!"
bodybuilding,Obliques look great man
bodybuilding,Yea man what‚Äôs the goods?
bodybuilding,Jeremy Buendia?
bodybuilding,How tall are you?
bodybuilding,"Well, they are wrong. Almost no pro bodybuilder squats heavier than high level Olympic weightlifters or powerlifters. Yet lean weightlifters or powerlifters don‚Äôt have their waists grow. That really only happens in super-heavyweight, when people push size and food too much."
bodybuilding,Lmao because technically Chris WAS prepped by an obese person aka Ian and still won.
bodybuilding,With the amount of training I‚Äôm sure he is.
bodybuilding,"Bro, just no..."
bodybuilding,Flexing in a thong is a sport?
bodybuilding,"According to Hani Rambod, Dennis James, Chris Aceto and Chris Cormier it has alot to do with heavy squats. Thats why I listed it they were all on the dj podcast talking about his stomach/waist"
bodybuilding,R U going to tell us where it is ?
bodybuilding,"Olympia main stage may be a niche thing but Bumstead has like 3.5 million followers on Tik Tok and 2.3 million on Youtube, Classic is a big niche these days and the little Physique lads are doing good too.  


The insulin whales are just advertising; the grotesque tip of a very big iceberg. Like the catwalk fashions nobody would be seen dead in."
bodybuilding,hany has some methods to bring his guys shredded and full to the stage
bodybuilding,"&gt;Wonder what the difference would be for tall guys

Your frame is larger so there's more potential for mass accrual, but you've got to eat it first."
bodybuilding,This is not a pay difference. This is prize money and not a salary. Most competitors do not even win prizes. Arguably the difference in prize money is determined by the popularity of the division.
bodybuilding,It's not about the cost it's about the principle of the matter. The ladies deserve to be earning whatever percentage of dollars they draw to the Olympia by being there. I'm sure it's more than sixty grand.
bodybuilding,"That‚Äôs all pretty much nonsense. 
Heavy squats won‚Äôt bulk up your waist. How would they?

The bloated waist comes form the tons of food these guys have to eat to be the size they are. (In combination with insulin and hgh of course). 

He really doesn‚Äôt have that issue at this point though. His waist might be a bit wide, but that‚Äôs just how he‚Äôs built. Also, you‚Äôll never really see lat development in a most muscular pose. The lats aren‚Äôt the focus and are basically hidden during the pose."
bodybuilding,"The physical activity is a means to an end, not the end in itself. My personal hesitation with calling BB a sport is twofold:

1. There's no physical activity on stage per se. There's nothing ""faster-higher-stronger"" in it.
2. Peaking for a show works to the detriment of ""faster-higher-stronger"""
bodybuilding,"I'd just do a bunch of dips, pushups, pullups, and chinups tbqh."
bodybuilding,Dante Trudel.
bodybuilding,"Also,chris gained more size in the off season so he will look better and bigger on stage than ever before"
bodybuilding,What about it?
bodybuilding,"By creating who exactly? Jay had 3 olympias when he came to hani, hadi and that woman beater mensphysique guy were elite before working with him"
bodybuilding,Are we looking at the same pic? Jacked? Yes. Aesthetic? No.
bodybuilding,He got the nickname before he worked with the elite...
bodybuilding,"You look fantastic dude, good luck!"
bodybuilding,This is enhanced body building so they can transform ALOT in 2 months. Especially when you are cutting and adding stuff like masteron and tren which just makes you look insane for show time
bodybuilding,Very true.
bodybuilding,"He made the announcement now, but we knew that he was working with Hany from June minimum. For some reason Chris didn‚Äôt want to announce this"
bodybuilding,"how much more can someone do in 2 months exactly , ik he was doing back and biceps to make them bigger for about a full year before they got really really huge .

also whats the deal with him switching coaches so late into prep?"
bodybuilding,"Keeping a tub of gainer has helped me avoid low days, switching up the program to keep stuff fresh has too. Gl brother you got this."
bodybuilding,Yeah but they don‚Äôt do the specific hamstring and glutes and ballsack pose that Platz used to do
bodybuilding,"This thread is incredibly old but idgaf. I hate training with people. When I first got into fitness I loved it because it was finally a sport I could take up by myself, blasting my favorite music and putting in the work. As I progressed, a few friends joined my gym because they wanted to take after my footsteps. The few days we did work out together were shitty as fuck. Like you explained, I just can't get in the zone if I'm with other people. I need to be in the zone, I need to be in my own world. Especially if I'm doing a leg day. Leg days are draining and I need to use all the energy I have to push through, not to chit-chat or to move weight plates around to accommodate to my partner's weight requirements."
bodybuilding,This is a problem even if you remove the word ‚Äòbodybuilders.‚Äô
bodybuilding,"The pro creator hahahahaha, only works with the elite of the elite"
bodybuilding,Chris could be prepped by an obese person and still win it
bodybuilding,Dude im a huge fan of bodybuilding but they‚Äôre just freaks to most of the public. It‚Äôs my favorite sport to follow but I can recognize it‚Äôs a very niche thing
bodybuilding,Jay Cutler.
bodybuilding,This is great that you can share this with your brother!
bodybuilding,Ty
bodybuilding,Sick
bodybuilding,Basically is short for gynecomastia. It‚Äôs caused by hormone fluctuations in males. Commonly caused by anabolic steroids but can be caused by other meds and factors as well. There can be two different kinds of gynecomastia but the guy here has glandular tissue behind the nipples causing his nipples to puff out like you see here. You can even see the enlarged glands behind the nipples due to his low body fat percentage. Only way for him to correct this would be surgery to have the glands removed. Hope this helps explain what it is
bodybuilding,What the fuck is a pump cover lmao
bodybuilding,"1. These are terrible right infringing, uncreative designs on stock images.

2. Id wager you didn‚Äôt find them, you made them, with lower effort than you should if you expect a successful business. It‚Äôs not that easy.

3. ‚ÄúPump cover‚Äù is a trademarked terms in textiles, you can not sell these as ‚Äúpump covers‚Äù"
bodybuilding,"Okay dude.....

The Miss America Pageant requires inordinate levels of dietary discipline and physical training in order to succeed at it. If you don't believe that then you've never looked in to what they do.

That right there is bodybuilding minus that pharmacy. 

If BB is a sport so is the MA pageant if this is ""The definition of sport is competitive physical activity. "" is in fact the definition. 

If the MA pageant is not a sport one of two things must be true...

1) It's not competitive

2) It's not a physical activity. 

MA pageantry is beyond all doubt completive so #1 is false. If working out and being on a strict diet just to get on stage with a spray tan and pose is enough to make Bodybuilding a physical activity than it's enough for the MA pageant. By your definition it's a sport."
bodybuilding,The lower height is definitely helping him look fuller though.

bodybuilding,"Love the sport but not really surprised at this. It‚Äôs an underground sport for people with self-image issues which makes it perfect for exploitation. Lee Priest said all this in an interview last year I believe. 

I wonder how involved Jim Manion was in this. This is not a good look at all for the Manions."
bodybuilding,Wow these are dumb. Like impressively dumb.
bodybuilding,this dude has a bad rep among the bodybuilding youtubers community. They always discredits what he say. Greg Doucette or Jonni Shreeve are examples of guys who appoint the mistakes in Athlean X videos.
bodybuilding,Pretty.

bodybuilding,"Truly elite aesthetic, very well done."

bodybuilding,"1) Define what a sport is.

bodybuilding,"Hmm good one, will look into it! Thanks!"
bodybuilding,"Mechanisms of hypertrophy are quite well known, very high frequencies kinda go against them as they wouldn‚Äôt allow for proper recovery. Many experienced coaches have tried different approaches and you‚Äôre rarely see anything over 2-3 times per week for a bodypart."
bodybuilding,Holy fuck
bodybuilding,Zyzz would be proud ü•≤
bodybuilding,"Mad respect, srs size bro"
bodybuilding,"I don't know man. Brothers biceps pops as well. Legs, yes but a bit of it is arms as well in my opinion."
bodybuilding,"Strength and size does tend to correlate though. And who knows, there might be something here for hypertrophy too?

If we just discard any unusual idea just because it doesnt jive with preconceived notions, how will we ever get anywhere?"
bodybuilding,Nice bubble butt hobbit.
bodybuilding,Quit playing victim. Seriously. I asked you a question and you gave me a smart ass response and then changed your tone when I called you out for being a jerk. Shut up. Seriously.
bodybuilding,"This sub isn‚Äôt for discussion‚Äôs on crimes, so why did you even comment‚Ä¶?

Is anything I said incorrect‚Ä¶?"
bodybuilding,"Yeah when the athlete can‚Äôt jog for 50 yards without having a heart attack, it‚Äôs not a sport."
bodybuilding,"Natty right, please?"
bodybuilding,"This is exactly the kind of low-effort, discussion-harming comment I wish Reddit would automatically ban. It adds nothing to the conversation while simultaneously attempting to downplay the importance of the crimes committed against these women."
bodybuilding,Because what works for getting stronger isn‚Äôt necessarily what‚Äôs best for growing bigger.
bodybuilding,Great proportions and inserts all around
bodybuilding,Women in this sport sacrifice the same amount as men do if not more (look up the menstrual/reproductive sides for a lot of these women). A pay difference that massive isn‚Äôt justifiable.
bodybuilding,Hell yeah keep it up bro
bodybuilding,"I know to not do heavy squats, eat super clean and honestly do not remember any of the other protocol.  Doing Vaccuums and keeping it tight."
bodybuilding,"Dumb but serious question from someone new to this, How does one get a waistline to come in?"
bodybuilding,congrats! wishing you a long successful career üí™üèª
bodybuilding,"True but a few cycles of anavar and low dose test is way cheaper than stacks of test, trenbolone, equipoise, HGH, sustanon, dbol, insulin, clenbuterol, and god knows what else."
bodybuilding,"Looking great. I'm 5' 6 and that's about my ideal look I'm striving for, or just close too it. Currently sitting around 165"
bodybuilding,"And again, this is a shitty, low-life sentiment to pull out on a bodybuilding sub."
bodybuilding,Correction: the IFBB is. The problem is not bodybuilding but its distortion by capitalist consumer entertainment.
bodybuilding,29
bodybuilding,"Much appreciated bro, quad training is my favourite"
bodybuilding,I will be in my off-season until spring time next year :)

bodybuilding,"Thanks for the feedback! I agree, need to figure out how to pose the lower in the RDB for sure."

bodybuilding,That‚Äôs not true. They still do the glutes pose for the categories
bodybuilding,"bodybuilding is 100% corrupt, fake, subjective, and highly exploitative."
bodybuilding,The definition of sport is competitive physical activity. In what realm is bodybuilding not competitive or physical?
bodybuilding,Who's gunna tell em?
bodybuilding,It‚Äôs not a sport. Even the non delusional men are aware of it. It‚Äôs entirely subjective and corrupt. the guys who run the leagues and the judges are very slimy.
bodybuilding,great quads
bodybuilding,Lol
bodybuilding,"It's a pursuit, that can be practiced competitively."
bodybuilding,"Nice, how long are you expecting this off-season to be?"

bodybuilding,Then fake natty
bodybuilding,Sort of a shit take for this sub dude. Very low-class.
bodybuilding,"Mad BroScientists of r/bb: if you broke your knee, how would you maximize upper body gains while it healed?

  
I fractured my tibia a few days ago, still waiting on an MRI but it seems likely I've torn my LCL and may need surgery. I'm gonna be off work for a while with very little to do except eat, rest, and beat the absolute brakes off of my apartment gym.

  
I'm already planning to really push Larsen press hard so I come back to a big bench, but I find myself in kind of a unique position - I have all the time in the world and can do basically as much volume as I can recover from, which should be a LOT considering (a) I'm not doing anything except lifting and bed rest and (b) I'm not gonna be able to do anything with my lower body for at least a month or two.

  
I have a good selection of dumbbells, a barbell, cage and adjustable bench, two cable stacks, a chin up bar, a chest/shoulder press and a machine pulldown. I'm getting around with a walker and a brace right now and have no problem sitting down and standing up, but I can't really bend that leg or put any weight on it, so I'm planning on doing lots of feet-up pressing, and I'm leaning towards a high-volume approach in general.  
Treat me like your guinea pig: what would you do if you were me? I'd also love rehab advice from anyone who's had a similar injury and returned to competition afterwards."
bodybuilding,"Your definition if beauty is painfully narrow. Aesthetics are beauty. Bodybuilding aesthetics are a very exaggerated, very specific form of beauty."
bodybuilding,"IFBB pro Kevin Jordan literally said it was a beauty contest to me in person. Cool guy, no airs."
bodybuilding,"It‚Äôs very unlikely to be natural, maybe somewhere someone could make this physique naturally but most can not."
bodybuilding,Great chest bro. Inspired!
bodybuilding,"This is better than my normal gym.

My recommendation: always take a look at the hotel gym as soon as possible. Most of them (in my experience) are just DBs up to 50 with an adjustable bench and a few treadmills. But I have been to one that was as equipped as a commercial gym: squat rack, bench press, etc."
bodybuilding,Nah it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. I invested in good underwear a while ago and I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why?
bodybuilding,A lot easier to use absolute shit form too on a free weight movement rather that a fixed path of travel
bodybuilding,"Big Ramy, so I can know exactly what his cycle is /s"
bodybuilding,"Not a bb, but doesn't chaffing bother you? I have naturally thick legs, so I purposefully don't train my legs for mass much (i do cycling tho) just to avoid chaffing, specially at the beach."
bodybuilding,"Ex-powerlifter here. 

I've allways been curious why very high frequency training hasnt caught on on bodybuilding.
If squatting 10-14 times per week, albeit with lower % of max than most us/non-eastern philosophy powerlifting programming uses produce results - why should bodybuilding be any different?"
bodybuilding,Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I saw the kids in my gym do that lmao
bodybuilding,"You look absolutely insane, can i respectfully ask if you take any gear (respectfully asking!)"
bodybuilding,"Great stuff , I know it‚Äôs much harder to compete natty , (only thing I‚Äôll say is you need to bring up the hams)."
bodybuilding,Guy on right looks like a real buff homelander
bodybuilding,"Fuck me in the ass for asking a question, I literally don‚Äôt know if you can do this naturally that why I asked fuck face"
bodybuilding,That‚Äôs awesome I‚Äôm honored
bodybuilding,Learn the way to take command. Use the power that's in your hand.
bodybuilding,"&gt; And please don't use smelling salts to squat 4 plates lol.

Would be pretty hilarious to see some dumb skinny bloke bang out a half rep with 405 after getting cracked out of his mind on salts tbh, i would certainly immediately stop whatever it is that i was doing and  go and give him a high five and hop on the hype train."

bodybuilding,"My man you have an ideal physique. 
Sent this to my wife and said this is the long term goal. 
Everything is so well balanced out. 
Can't wait to see the final result!"
bodybuilding,"It‚Äôs a sport, beauty at least on the men‚Äôs side is far from the end goal."
bodybuilding,"Who said anything about aesthetics? You talked about proportions, and thats exactly what they judge."
bodybuilding,"Thank you! Posing has been the hardest part for me. 

That crinkle was always a concern of mine too, I called it my gills. My posing coach said it‚Äôs a generic thing so it isn‚Äôt judged as a negative. Some pros have it too."
bodybuilding,Sorry competitive physical activity
bodybuilding,"If you improve the leg posing, that RDB is a winner shot, impressive!"
bodybuilding,It isn‚Äôt a sport. It‚Äôs a beauty Pageant
bodybuilding,"Not gonna name names, but the epidemic of bodybuilding guys who are clearly racist and/or bigoted being obsessed with black bodybuilding chicks is both bizarre and troubling.

bodybuilding,"I‚Äôve apologized for hurting your feelings, I‚Äôve deleted the comment, and I‚Äôve offered amends. Yet all you have done is continue to curse and spew toxic venom at me and can‚Äôt move on from this. What else would you like? Would you like to insult me more?

bodybuilding,Judges don't dictate my aesthetic preferences.

**From reporters Desmond Butler, Amy Brittain and Alice Li:**

Officials of bodybuilding‚Äôs two premier federations have been sexually exploiting female athletes for decades ‚Äî pressuring them to pose for nude photographs, posting those photos to soft-core pornography sites, and, at times, manipulating contest results in favor of cooperative competitors, a Washington Post investigation has found.  
  
For more than 15 years, J.M. Manion, whose father, Jim, has been running amateur and professional bodybuilding contests for decades, shot the photos and operated a network of paid soft-core pornography websites that at one point advertised ‚Äúover 30,000 images‚Äù of competitors in the sport. A Post review of website archives identified more than 200 female athletes in photos ranging from casual bikini shots to graphic, sexual images, including those of nude women together in beds, bathtubs and showers. One of J.M.'s sites, Fitness Divas, bluntly stated: ‚ÄúYour Favorite Fitness Athletes ‚Ä¶Naked!‚Äù  
  
Jenn Gates, who won the figure category at the prestigious Olympia contest in 2008, graced the covers of fitness magazines and earned enough sponsorship money to quit her nursing job. Her manager, J.M., asked her to take off her bikini top and bottom for photos. Gates refused, and was surprised recently to learn from Post reporters that her swimsuit photos had been featured alongside nude female competitors on one of J.M.‚Äôs pornography sites.

‚ÄúI never consented to having my pictures put on a soft-porn site,‚Äù Gates said during an interview at her home in Indianapolis. Less than three years after winning the Olympia, Gates gave up the sport in disgust ‚Äî and warns young women to stay away from the contests.  
  
Interviews with dozens of competitors, judges, officials and others connected to the sport reveal the systematic exploitation of female athletes often rendered vulnerable by extreme dieting and workouts, lack of financial stability and a drive to win. The Post found that some women believed their scores depended on their willingness to pose for sexual photos or to please the sport‚Äôs leading judges, promoters and managers, almost all of whom are male.  
  
J.M. did not respond to questions The Post emailed him about the allegations. Rob Rosetti, a prominent trainer who sometimes attended the photo shoots for J.M.‚Äôs pornography websites, said the women had consented.

bodybuilding,Stabilo
bodybuilding,"Because you were not adding value to the community by making crappy comments instead of just answering the question that clearly other people wanted the answer to. Then after more than one person called you out on it you come back acting like you‚Äôre on a high horse for pretending to save face when you gave a non answer in response. You‚Äôre not the better person, you‚Äôre just pretending to be."
bodybuilding,Gyno?
bodybuilding,"Ha, well yes if you are talking about regulating your HPA axis (due to testosterone deficiency) but it‚Äôs still a steroid (exogenous) which has adverse side effects for people who don‚Äôt have a testosterone deficiency."
bodybuilding,Thanks King üòé
bodybuilding,"I‚Äôd say clean foods mostly. Chicken breast, ground beef, eggs for protein. Shakes. Rice potatoes and oatmeal for carbs"
bodybuilding,"Show us the back Michal, the back."
bodybuilding,"Dude what‚Äôs your problem? I apologized to you and offered you an olive branch. If you don‚Äôt want it or accept it, that‚Äôs fine. But there‚Äôs no need for cursing or name calling."
bodybuilding,"I won‚Äôt disagree that there are certainly ways to mitigate the clinical complications of anabolic use. The user must recognize that, even at lower doses, they are going to be at higher risk (sometimes substantially higher) of serious complications either now or 5 years from now. They should also know that the mitigating measures are NOT necessarily reversing the problematic pathophysiology but are trying to (as the name implies) mitigate the damage done. I just think that we‚Äôre in the risky era of lifting. When high schoolers are starting on SARMs and switching to gear in their 20s. I mean, 18-20 year olds hitting 800 DL while being lean? Have you seen the average lifting influencers now? Compared to 10 years ago it‚Äôs amazing how much bigger and stronger everyone has gotten. There is an ever increasing self inflicted ‚Äúneed‚Äù to be as jacked as the people we see on instagram but you can‚Äôt do that without üßÉ

But,Truth be told, everything humans do for enjoyment carries risk. Like I said (and I‚Äôm being non-sarcastic), maybe the risk is worth it for the sick gains."
bodybuilding,What advice would you give for someone to get their nutrition on point?
bodybuilding,Pretty much always stuck in that rep range except when I was younger I‚Äôd max out but I don‚Äôt do that anymore. I‚Äôd say focus hard on training for feel as opposed to strength and diet as well. Amazing what diet can do for you natural or not
bodybuilding,We used to have a 6‚Äô7 guy who did a few natty comps. Could search the sub and see if his posts are still up.
bodybuilding,I think you look cool :)
bodybuilding,"I did a few years ago, i got stronger but made no real size gains. Admittedly that could have been because of my diet. All in all, I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it."
bodybuilding,"You guys chose the right parents, Jesus!"
bodybuilding,Also appreciate the quick reply man :)
bodybuilding,Have you been training like this thru the entirety of your bodybuilding journey or did you go thru some pplpplr or full body routines as well? Do you have any recommendations for a natural trying to make it big
bodybuilding,Wish I suited a backwards cap but I just look like a fucking pokemon trainer
bodybuilding,Looking like high school bully to ifbb pro transformating
bodybuilding,incredible physique! inspiring stuff
bodybuilding,Awesome. Good job to you both!
bodybuilding,"I train 4 days a week. Usually 8-12 rep range hard contractions and good control. Chest/tris, back/bis, legs, shoulders/more arms"

bodybuilding,Don‚Äôt come in here now trying to act like you know something after your little toxic ‚Äúgo look it up‚Äù bullshit comment.

bodybuilding,bro. absolutely solid fuckin work.
bodybuilding,"fair, long term high use is unhealthy, and you can't safely do it.   but there are MANY things that can be done to mitigate negative health implications ."
bodybuilding,"You just said 1970s bodybuilders would look like monsters as well if they could push the envelope as much as modern bbers do, make up your mind bruh"
bodybuilding,Sports evolve and the standards change. Saying modern day bbers look like bad guy monsters is ridiculous and hardly a ‚Äúfact‚Äù
bodybuilding,My argument isn‚Äôt primarily about the mortality outcomes from all bodybuilders. I don‚Äôt have that data. My argument is about the pathophysiology of anabolic drug use/overuse. At a cellular and organelle level the effects of anabolics (especially at the dosage take by IFBB pros) is harmful for your body.
bodybuilding,"I apologize to you personally if my comment offended you. This is a sincere apology and offer to you: I have a great book that taught me a lot of the basics to bodybuilding that you won‚Äôt learn on here. I promise I‚Äôm not baiting you or anything like that, if you would like it, I can send you a copy of the book to read. Again, I apologize, and I have deleted the comment. I really hope your gyno issue resolves itself as you finish puberty. Have a great day."

bodybuilding,"them being brothers doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean their genetics will be super similar. yes, they obviously have a higher likelyhood of sharing genetic traits but it‚Äôs still quite random at the end of the day"
bodybuilding,"I find this argument faulty.   you look at the ones who haven't mitigated risk and died and say ""see they all die"", but what about all the top 90s guys still alive?   all the top 2000 guys still alive?  you're looking at just the negative data points and saying that's all the data points"
bodybuilding,What the fuck do you do for forearms
bodybuilding,"It‚Äôs not even just genetics. It‚Äôs ability to recruit and connect with a muscle, lifestyle outside of the gym, enjoyment of training said body part (much more likely to excel in the body parts you enjoy training), pain tolerance etc"
bodybuilding,I always heard rumors of this .. guess it‚Äôs true
bodybuilding,What a dumb post. I bet if any of the 1970 BBers could push the limits like we have done now they all would have.

bodybuilding,Thank you for this. Cross-posting the text to r/bikinitalk
bodybuilding,You both look insane great job!
bodybuilding,"Yes but as they are brothers, their genetics are rather similar. That's why I was interested if there was a major difference on what made the difference."
bodybuilding,Also only opinion of the judges. But what do they know.
bodybuilding,"Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man."
bodybuilding,You‚Äôre safe to click it.
bodybuilding,Unfortunately that‚Äôs not how it works. 2 people doing the exact same workouts can create different physiques. Everyone‚Äôs different.
bodybuilding,Too wide. His waistline needs to come in more or get his lats much wider... or both. The rest of his physique is insane imo
bodybuilding,Them forearms are thicker than lead bro nice work
bodybuilding,"When it comes to training, Nick Gloff. But regarding nutrition, gear, addressing health issues and so on, probably John Jewett like u/macmacc said."
bodybuilding,"Ive had golfers elbow and tennis elbow and my friend, I have good news! You can fix it hecka easy! It's a simple stretch. [stretch](https://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wrist-flexor-stretch560.jpg)

Hold for 20 seconds at a time, I was doing them all throughout the day. You can also ice after stretching if you want, I didn't and saw relief in days. After couple weeks, pain free. 

Also you have a weak link someplace which usually is at the wrist. Your shoulder arm hand is a chain, if there's a weakness someplace you will get chronic pain someplace like you are. It's either your shoulder complex or wrist weakness. Along with the stretch I showed you I would advise strengthening rotator cuffs and do forearm work. Wrist curls reverse wrist curls, if your gym has one there's a machine you roll a weight up and down using wrists. 

Take my advice and you should see if not immediate relief you should definitely see relief within two to three weeks."

bodybuilding,"Looks good! 

Your changes to posing posture are definitely good (head tilt, chest turned more, near shoulder lower, feet closer).

I'm not good on figure posing, so might be not a points detriment, but I might see about tweaking posture for the crinkle above the hip near ribs. Or that might just be the name of the game.

Either way, those tweaks you've already made are great!"

bodybuilding,"&gt; No one is a PT here

Some are. But the qualified ones are not giving advice based off of reddit comments, generally speaking. (And theyre mostly wincing at advice being given by the unqualified."
bodybuilding,If it‚Äôs new most AI would address this. If it‚Äôs pre-existing his best chance aside from surgery is Letrozole. Surgery will go in and actually remove the breast tissue
bodybuilding,"I couldn't care less lol, my parents are both in the medical field and in my career field I'm tested on a full blood panel regularly. 

Misconceptions and disingenuous statements without knowledge of the facts are dangerous in bodybuilding, PED's certainly aren't healthy. They *can* shorten your lifespan. But there's plenty of information on how to do it right and stay semi-health conscious. 

Just because every 20 year old on /r/steroids is running 100mg of tren 300mg dnp two anadrol, and half a gram of test everyday doesn't mean everyone on gear is running the same dosages (not putting words in your mouth). The dosages of 7/10 people on reddit would far exceed what most pros run unless they are prepping for a show."
bodybuilding,"Unless you're Will Tennyson there's really no incentive to be natty, and every incentive to juice."
bodybuilding,"Good job of improving the conditioning, I see more overall detail in the first pic va the 2nd.  And I think having that little tweak in your left foot placement and right arm, and twisting the torso just a pinch more upright flatters the flow of your physique."
bodybuilding,Wrong!!!! once you have gyno it doesn‚Äôt come and go. It‚Äôs not like herpes. It doesn‚Äôt just pop up and go away at will and come back anytime you don‚Äôt want it to. You have to treat it with medicine or surgery. In your case when you started puberty you may have gotten a little case of it but when you are done with puberty it will go most likely go away.

bodybuilding,"Team Bombshell

Thompson, a former senior judge on the bodybuilding circuit, admits to witnessing inappropriate behavior and engaging in it himself ‚Äî sins, he said, that he acknowledged only after finding religion.

In 2005, during his first judging experience, he got a quick education in the power that judges hold over athletes. While in his hotel room, Thompson said, he got a call from Shannon Dey, who alongside her then-husband, Rosetti, led a Florida-based group of competitors called Team Bombshell.

Dey told him that she wanted to send a woman to his room to make sure that she looked ready for the next day‚Äôs competition. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYeah, okay, that‚Äôs great,‚Äô ‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúLike, I don‚Äôt even know what judges do at this point.‚Äù Then, he said, the woman walked into his room, dropped her robe and was naked underneath. He said she began to spin around and asked him, ‚ÄúIs there anything that I might do to make your life a little easier today?‚Äù Thompson sheepishly said no. Later that evening, he said that Tuman, the show promoter, quipped: ‚ÄúI heard you didn‚Äôt partake of the fruit.‚Äù

A spokesman for Team Bombshell, Art Sims, said that they had no ‚Äúofficial comment.‚Äù

After that, Thompson said his life ‚Äúspun out,‚Äù and he had frequent sexual encounters with competitors. In 2015, Thompson fell out publicly with the Manions after a legal dispute over the future of the organization, in which he tried to establish a rival bodybuilding federation.

Several of the women who posed nude described being recruited by Bombshell‚Äôs Dey and Rosetti. The couple have since divorced, but Dey continues to run Bombshell.

One woman, a former Bombshell team member who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of privacy concerns, shared emails from Dey that instructed her top athletes on how to keep J.M. happy during photo shoots.

‚ÄúThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity to shoot with the Man who made the careers of some of the greatest IFBB Pro‚Äôs,‚Äù Dey wrote in April 2009. ‚ÄúI can not stress enough how fortunate we are to have been chosen.‚Äù

The email included numbered rules for the shoot at Manion‚Äôs studio in Pittsburgh. ‚ÄúNo full bottom suits. Brazillian and thong bottoms only,‚Äù Dey wrote. ‚ÄúABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINING. If it‚Äôs cold you don‚Äôt act cold, if it‚Äôs hot don‚Äôt act hot, hungry don‚Äôt say a word, etc.‚Äù

She added that no boyfriends or husbands could attend.

The Bombshell team member said she attended a photo shoot in a hotel room with J.M., another female competitor and edible props, including whipped cream and chocolate. J.M. photographed the scene.

‚ÄúI kind of felt like this is the game and you‚Äôve got to play along because this is the son of the head of the sport,‚Äù she said.

A second Bombshell member who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her privacy recalled that she had repeatedly made it clear to both Rosetti and J.M. that she would pose topless but would never agree to full nudity.

At a national competition roughly a decade ago, J.M. requested that she attend a photo shoot involving two other women.

‚ÄúI hear J.M. call my name, and I‚Äôm thinking he needs me to hold a reflector or a light or something,‚Äù she said. She rounded the corner in the hotel and saw J.M. standing near a bathroom and Rosetti sitting on a love seat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòHey, yeah, what do you need?‚Äù she recalled. J.M. nodded toward the two women, who were naked in the shower.

‚ÄúAnd he says, ‚ÄòGet in.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd he says, ‚ÄòGet in with them.‚Äô ‚Äù

She looked to Rosetti for help, she said, because he also knew her objections to fully nude photographs. But he did not intervene. ‚ÄúYou pulled the rug out from under me and set me up,‚Äù she thought.

The woman said she viewed noncompliance as ‚Äúcareer suicide.‚Äù She undressed and stood in the corner of the shower, as far away as possible from the other two women.

When it was over, she went back to her hotel room, sick to her stomach.

Rosetti told The Post that at the shoots he attended the women signed a release form before the shoots and were ‚Äúwell aware days in advance‚Äù that they ‚Äúwere ‚Äòglamour‚Äô fitness photography sessions,‚Äù he said in a text message.

‚ÄúWhat the athletes brought to the shoots was their decision. Outfits were not provided by anyone. If they wished to be photographed in swim suits, lingerie, implied nude or nude, it was done completely on the athlete‚Äôs own free will.‚Äù

‚ÄòBlacklisted‚Äô

Many of the women interviewed said that saying no to the Manions had its price. Ava Cowan, who competed professionally in the figure category, said J.M. attempted to sign her in the mid-2000s after she showed early promise. But a friend who was a lawyer reviewed the contract, telling Cowan she would be ‚Äúout of your mind‚Äù to sign.

‚ÄúHe will own you,‚Äù the friend warned. After she ‚Äúblew off‚Äù J.M.‚Äôs proposed contract, Cowan said, she placed poorly in a national show. Frustrated, she took to an online bodybuilding forum to voice her objections over the family‚Äôs outsize influence.

‚ÄúI posted a paragraph about how corrupt everything was, how you have to sign a contract to place well, how it‚Äôs like the mafia,‚Äù she said. Less than an hour later, she deleted the post.

‚ÄúBut the damage was done,‚Äù she said, noting that she soon heard her remarks had gotten back to the Manions. Cowan said she was ‚Äúblacklisted‚Äù for four years as she struggled to make any income.

‚ÄúYou can never come back. Even if you‚Äôre back, you‚Äôre ostracized forever,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was just kind of drug through the mud eternally.‚Äù

After a potential sponsor said he did not want to upset the Manions by signing her, she said she was able to salvage the deal by apologizing to the family for her remarks.

Cowan also agreed to pose for J.M. in lingerie. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do nudity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt judge it, but what I do judge is when you feel like you have to do it to place well.‚Äù

In 2011, she finished No. 3 in the figure category at both the Arnold Classic and Olympia competitions. Later, in a final attempt to reach the top, she said she signed with J.M. Her career fizzled soon after, she said, when she suffered a neck injury during a backstage accident.

Garcia, the bikini competitor who said she refused sexual advances, said that crossing J.M. could quickly kill a career. When her son had just turned 1 and was still breastfeeding, she entered her first bodybuilding contest. Her coach advised her to try to sign with J.M.‚Äôs Fitness Management Group. ‚ÄúThe girls on that team, they usually place better,‚Äù Garcia said. ‚ÄúPeople know who they are.‚Äù

At the next show, she asked J.M. for a chance. Soon, she had a contract, a pro card and an invitation to Pittsburgh for a bikini shoot in his studio. She was short on money and caring for her baby but did not hesitate to make the four-hour drive from D.C.

J.M. began setting her competitive schedule, and Garcia started to do well. At a show in Orlando in April 2013, she placed third behind two of his athletes who would later win the Olympia. The following day, she was invited to a hotel pool for a photo shoot with a male competitor.

While J.M. shot still photographs, a videographer filmed the scene under a pool waterfall with Garcia in a thong bikini and the male bodybuilder‚ÄØin tight shorts.

‚ÄúI want the models to be themselves and loosen up,‚Äù J.M. says in the video.

At one point, Garcia bent forward laughing, while the man put his hand on her back. She says that the video was edited to make it look like the two were having sex.

Videographer John Hawley, in a text message to a Post reporter, said he edited the film to emphasize the look J.M. ‚Äúappeared to be going for.""

Garcia says she now cringes at the footage, particularly the flattery she directed toward J.M. At the time, she called the‚ÄØphotos‚ÄØ‚Äúhot‚Äù and said she was happy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure that I was just lying out of my face,‚Äù she now says.

J.M. soon approached her about shooting nude for ‚Äúa website where the athletes make money.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, she said, and showed off some website photos: two athletes she knew, both naked and making out in a shower.

‚ÄúI started to make the connections,‚Äù she said, recognizing some of the women who had bested her in recent competitions. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòOh, my goodness.‚Äô ‚Äù

Garcia explained to J.M. that she drew the line at bikini shots. She had a young son and couldn‚Äôt imagine having nude photos online that he might someday find.

Not long afterward, a letter from J.M. arrived in the mail.

‚ÄúAt this time since we have nothing in the foreseeable horizon for you in terms of paid work we are officially terminating your Bikini-Fitness-Figure Competitor/Model Contract with Fitness Management Group,‚Äù read the letter Garcia shared with The Post.

Garcia said she viewed the termination as a direct result of refusing to take nude photographs. In the years since, she has struggled to maintain steady employment, survived a major car accident and experienced bouts of homelessness.

To Gates, the demands on female athletes were bad enough, but the bikini division horrified her. After she left the sport, women came to her and asked her to coach them so they could compete in the bikini contests for the NPC and potentially the Olympia.

Gates had never seen a bikini show.

‚ÄúAnd then I started watching it online and like, there is no way I am going to work with a girl and tell her how to turn around and poke her ass out,‚Äù Gates said. ‚ÄúI just morally, I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like it got a lot worse after I got out, which is kind of like a godsend for me ‚Äî that I did get out.‚Äù"

bodybuilding,"‚ÄòAbsolutely disgusting‚Äô
The effort to recruit women to pose provocatively extended beyond the Manions. Multiple women described close associates of the family who introduced them to J.M. and encouraged them to do whatever he asked, saying that it would launch their careers from amateur status to professionals. Earning a coveted pro card could make bodybuilding less of an expensive hobby and more of an income-generating career.

The women said the network of enablers allowed sexual harassment to thrive in plain sight. They described judges and promoters requesting private visits to their hotel rooms and sponsors making sexual passes.

When Gates traveled to Los Angeles in 2009 to promote a supplements company, the owner, Moe Elmoussawi, asked her to stay with him. She called J.M. to ask how to handle the request since she did not feel comfortable. J.M. told her she risked making the sponsor ‚Äúangry.‚Äù She booked her own hotel.

On a trip to New Zealand, Gates said Elmoussawi made an ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù pass at her while the two were traveling together. She bolted from his truck to escape, she said, and shortly afterward recounted the story to her then-partner, whom she has since married, and a coach. The Post confirmed that account with both of them.

Reached for comment in New Zealand, Elmoussawi denied any impropriety.

‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt believe that she would say anything negative about me,‚Äù he texted The Post. ‚ÄúI have always treated her with ultimate respect and when she came to NZ she met with my wife and kids.‚Äù

Henderson, the former sheriff‚Äôs deputy, heard about J.M.‚Äôs success as a manager from Tuman, whom she met through a trainer at her gym. Tuman assured her that if she signed with J.M. and did the photo shoots, she said, she would win her pro card.

Henderson recalled that in about 2005, the day before her first competition, Tuman told her to visit his hotel room to learn how to pose.

‚ÄúI was a little nervous to meet anybody in their hotel room by myself,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was a cop at this time, so I did have a little bit of a clue that maybe going to someone‚Äôs room, a male that I just met, would not be a good idea.‚Äù

Her husband and young son tagged along. Tuman was clearly surprised when he opened the door, she said.

‚ÄúThe look on his face, it was kind of like, ‚ÄòOh, you brought your husband and your son,‚Äô ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was kind of like, ‚ÄòOh, I didn‚Äôt expect that.‚Äô ‚Äù

Tuman also served as the competition‚Äôs head judge. She placed poorly, and Henderson said that Tuman then suggested she meet J.M. for career guidance.

Over the next two years, despite posing for J.M. in a bikini photo shoot, Henderson continued to struggle in competitions. She said Tuman assured her that doing more photo shoots and signing with J.M. would result in a pro card. In an email to J.M., which Henderson shared with The Post, she wrote that she had no issue with nudity and was eager to take photos. J.M. sent her a contract with her name filled in, promising a 50-50 profit split for websites that involved ‚ÄúPlayboy-style‚Äù photos. Henderson recalls signing it and faxing it back, although the emails do not confirm that the agreement was ever finalized.

Her first nude photo shoot occurred in a Las Vegas hotel room with two other women during a competition weekend. She said J.M. took the photos while Tuman directed the women.

In one photo, Henderson appears nude with the other athletes, according to archived website images. In another photo, the three women pose in bed together, wearing high heels and red lingerie.

‚ÄúIt was, you know, John saying, ‚ÄòOkay, take off your tops‚Äô and ‚ÄòOkay, you tug on that‚Äô and ‚ÄòYou guys pretend to look at each other and pretend to kiss‚Äô or ‚ÄòDo this‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou turn around and stick out your butts.‚Äô And you know, we‚Äôre fully naked,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI just remember thinking to myself, ‚ÄòOkay, this is all worth it.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ I was now doing this shoot and I was going to get my pro card, and then I was going to go and be this big, famous fitness girl.‚Äù

During the shoot, she said, Tuman approached her from behind. ‚ÄúHe put his arms, his hands, on my shoulders, and he put his groin against my rear end,‚Äù she said. He told her that she looked ‚Äúreally, really good‚Äù and that the photo shoot looked ‚Äúreally hot.‚Äù

She laughed it off but felt deeply uncomfortable. ‚ÄúIt was absolutely disgusting,‚Äù she said.

Reached last week by The Post, Tuman said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. I‚Äôm a married man. I‚Äôm a family man. I have no idea what you are talking about.‚Äù

Asked whether he wanted to hear about specific allegations, Tuman said: ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. Because it‚Äôs all lies.‚Äù

Henderson posed nude for at least one other group photo shoot. Her husband, Kenneth Henderson, said in a phone interview that his wife frequently confided in him about what was happening.

‚ÄúThere was a normalcy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like you said no. I never heard of someone saying no.‚Äù

At a 2009 national competition, Henderson placed fourth. She was livid that her pro card status remained elusive despite agreeing to nude photography. Once offstage, she confronted Tuman, saying: ‚ÄúWhat the f---? Why didn‚Äôt I get my pro card?‚Äù

When he told her she hadn‚Äôt visited him the night before, she grew even angrier.

Henderson raised her voice and asked, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying that because I didn‚Äôt go to your room and give you a blow job or f--- you, I didn‚Äôt get my pro card today?‚Äù

Tuman told her that she had misunderstood his comment, she said.

In 2010, Henderson placed first in the USA Championships, an NPC competition, and finally earned her pro card. Then she quit the sport.

‚ÄúIt was not the best person onstage that was winning,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was the person that was J.M.‚Äôs favorite or whoever was doing the most for J.M. and whoever would bring in the most money.‚Äù

Henderson‚Äôs law enforcement career later ended in scandal after she was accused of faking an injury and improperly collecting workers‚Äô compensation benefits. In 2019, she pleaded no contest to a felony count of making a false or fraudulent claim or statement and was sentenced to six months of house arrest. After successfully completing probation, Henderson‚Äôs record was expunged, according to county court records.

She has returned to the sport, competing in the Manions‚Äô IFBB Pro masters‚Äô bikini division for athletes over 40. She said that this time, her eyes are open.

‚ÄúIt still is a toxic environment. It hasn‚Äôt changed much,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI am truly competing for myself.‚Äù"

bodybuilding,"‚ÄòEpic booty pose‚Äô
After an amateur event in New Jersey earlier this year, J.M. lined up nine of the top female competitors on the asphalt in front of a New Jersey Marriott, their backs to him.

‚ÄúAll right, so this will be the epic booty pose,‚Äù he tells them, according to video footage posted on the NPC News Online website.

He directs the women to stick out their butts and brace themselves with a hand on the athlete next to them.

J.M., now 59, grew up in the bodybuilding world, and then became official photographer and senior writer for NPC News in the mid ‚Äô80s when it was a magazine.

J.M.‚Äôs ventures converged in the late 1990s when he launched his Erotic Fitness paid website to sell topless and fully nude photos of star female bodybuilders. ‚ÄúGym workouts sans tops are too rare!‚Äù the website stated. ‚ÄúHow many times have you been in a gym, seen a fine babe, and wished she was doing those chest flys topless?‚Äù

Erotic Fitness folded in 2000, but J.M. soon launched larger websites: Alluring Fitness and Fitness Divas. Over time, his photography grew more sexually graphic and targeted in its attempts to lure paid subscribers. The websites disappeared in 2015 with no explanation. It is unclear how much income J.M. collected from the sites.

A Post review of J.M.‚Äôs past websites found that of the more than 200 featured athletes, a third posed in bikinis, which are traditionally worn for bodybuilding and fitness competitions. More than a quarter of the women posed either fully or partially nude or in suggestive settings, according to archived images of the websites reviewed by Post reporters. A smaller number posed in lingerie. For others, the nature of the photography could not be discerned from archival screenshots.

A handful of women said that they had no problem with lingerie or sensual photographs and did not view the photography as a significant departure from a sport judged on one‚Äôs appearance in little clothing.

‚ÄúI actually loved doing pictures,‚Äù said Timea Majorova, a former professional competitor who was born in the former Czechoslovakia. She said she benefited from J.M.‚Äôs career management in the 1990s when, then in her early 20s and knowing little English, she tried to adjust to life in the United States.

‚ÄúHe was very nice to me. He never pushed me to do anything,‚Äù she said, noting that she never posed nude, nor did J.M. ask her to do so. ‚ÄúAs far as I know, the girls I worked with, they never told me they were pushed to do anything.‚Äù

Several women spoke to The Post about their experiences on the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy and out of fear of retaliation.

One woman who competed from 2008 to 2010 said that she signed with J.M. because she believed he would look out for her and help her gain a platform in the fitness industry. Her first photo shoot took place with other women, all in bikinis, on a California beach. But the next photo shoot took a troubling turn, she said.

A couple of days before a competition, she said, she was asked to join two women in a hotel room, wearing lingerie and posing in bed. Then, J.M. asked her to remove her clothing. She agreed.

‚ÄúI felt that if I said no, that could end my career,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut that could have just been me. I knew how known and powerful [J.M.] was in that world. And that was the choice I made. I call it the dark side.‚Äù

A Fitness Management Group contract shared by bodybuilder Mandy Henderson.

Agreeing to the photography stripped the joy from the sport, she said.

‚ÄúI felt ashamed,‚Äù the woman said. ‚ÄúI felt like a failure. I felt scared. I felt like I made poor decisions, and then I felt trapped.‚Äù

A second woman ‚Äî then a single mother who competed in the early 2010s ‚Äî described a similar, rapid progression from an initial bikini shoot to nude photography. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how he operates,‚Äù she said of J.M., noting that women developed a whisper network to warn one another of what was next.

She said holding such photo shoots before competitions amounted to ‚Äútaking advantage‚Äù of women who dieted and trained to the extreme for months, knowing that contest results were on the line.

A third woman, who competed in the mid-to-late 2000s, said that J.M. once suggested she dress in comic hero costumes, catering to his fascination with comic book culture and his desire to show real-life female bodybuilders as fictional, sensual superheroes who fought off villains.

Then, she said, he directed her to strike a sexy pose and undress.

Though she could not locate the document, she recalls signing a contract that included language about photo shoots and paid websites and promised a 50-50 profit split with J.M.‚Äôs company. She did not have a problem with ‚Äútasteful‚Äù nudity and needed the money. Bodybuilding ‚Äúwas not cheap,‚Äù she said.

But after being photographed, she felt ‚Äúmortified,‚Äù especially when several contest judges remarked that they had seen her photos. J.M. wanted her to promote the website to drive up membership numbers, she said, but she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to do it.

‚ÄúI never got one dollar,‚Äù she said. Not too long after, J.M. terminated her contract, telling her: ‚ÄúI never made any money off of you,‚Äù she said."
bodybuilding,"Exploited for decades, female bodybuilders speak out
A Washington Post investigation found that scores of female athletes were sexually exploited by officials of the two major U.S. bodybuilding federations.

J.M., who runs the sport‚Äôs online news operation, also oversaw a management company that directed the careers of the top female competitors, including Gates. He served as a gateway to endorsement deals, magazine covers and other financially promising opportunities and could shut down income potential or competitive success if an athlete crossed him, numerous competitors said.

Two former officials told The Post that they witnessed other officials either inflating scorecards in favor of competitors managed by J.M. or trying to.

Steve O‚ÄôBrien, who served as a judge and district chairman of the NPC for Northern California, recounted two incidents when he said John Tuman, a judge, changed scores, once after O‚ÄôBrien observed him discussing the placings with Jim and J.M. Manion.

Jim Rockell, who was once the head judge of the Olympia and a close associate of Jim Manion‚Äôs before a falling out, said that Tuman once chided him at an event about his placings and suggested he make changes.

‚ÄúTuman leans over to me and says, ‚ÄòYou know that girl that you got in fourth or fifth place? That‚Äôs one of J.M.‚Äôs girls,‚Äô ‚Äù Rockell recalled. He said he did not change his scores.

O‚ÄôBrien and Rockell said that some years ago, Tuman was suspended as a judge after his then-fiancee provided evidence that Tuman had affairs with contestants while he was judging. Several athletes also complained to officials about Tuman‚Äôs behavior, they said. Months later, Jim Manion called O‚ÄôBrien to discuss reinstating Tuman, which O‚ÄôBrien resisted. But Manion overruled him.

‚ÄúJim‚Äôs remedy was: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going have him judge women,‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien said. ‚ÄúWell, that didn‚Äôt last very long.‚Äù

Soon, Tuman was back to judging all kinds of contests across the country, O‚ÄôBrien said.

Tuman declined to comment on specific allegations.

Rockell said he often observed Jim Manion complimenting J.M.‚Äôs clients to the judges during contests. ‚ÄúAnd these are the women that were winning,‚Äù he added.

The federations declined to answer questions about J.M‚Äôs influence on the contests. But The Post found that at the 2013 Olympia, among the 20 athletes who placed in the top 10 of the bikini or figure divisions, at least 18 were at one time listed on J.M.‚Äôs business websites as clients.

The Post attempted to contact more than 80 of the 200 athletes who appeared on J.M.‚Äôs websites. The majority did not respond to requests for comment. Twenty women agreed to speak to Post reporters about their experiences. Of those, nine women who had posed nude agreed to be interviewed ‚Äî with eight speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from the Manion family and damage to their current careers if the photos received public attention.

Several women described personal problems and vulnerabilities that made them susceptible to posing nude: financial strain, troubles at home or feeling they had no other option if they wanted to advance in the sport.

The women told The Post that nude photo shoots were often held a day or two before the weekend competitions, and they believed that their odds of winning depended on their state of undress. The events were so regular, a former judge and top Manion lieutenant, Lee Thompson, told The Post, that they were called ‚ÄúThursday shower nights.‚Äù

Thompson, who split with the Manions several years ago, said that Jim Manion would sometimes clear out of his hotel suite so that J.M. could do the shoots there, indicating that the elder Manion was aware of his son‚Äôs photo shoots.

J.M. advertised ‚Äúfan clubs‚Äù of certain women, charging roughly $10 a month for access to their photos. Several women said they did not know they had been featured on the websites until Post reporters notified them. Other women described signing contracts that promised a 50-50 profit split with J.M.‚Äôs company, along with a regular review of invoices. With one exception, the women told The Post they did not recall receiving money from income the websites generated. One woman said she got just $40. Post reporters reviewed three athlete contracts, along with emails exchanged between J.M. or his associates and some of the competitors.

Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an Olympic gold medalist swimmer and a lawyer who runs Champion Women, a group that advocates for girls and women in sports, said that bodybuilding managers, judges or promoters may have more sway over athletes because the sport is based on subjective scoring.

That power dynamic means that the sport has a responsibility to protect its athletes, she said: ‚ÄúThe bodybuilding industry should be subject to very strict precautions for athletes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not consent when it‚Äôs your boss and it‚Äôs someone that holds power over you.‚Äù

The Manions‚Äô bodybuilding empire is a private, for-profit company, with no oversight structure or requirement to share revenue or membership numbers. Competitors described an overall lack of transparency within the sport. They told The Post that the organizations are devoid of any meaningful safeguards for athletes, such as a human resources department, health insurance or unions that could protect against abuses of power.

For Gates, the sport lost its way with the addition of the bikini division, which was introduced to the Olympia competition in 2010.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what woman would want other women to stand up onstage and turn around and show their behinds and then be told to walk halfway across the stage and poke their butts out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy are we doing this?‚Äù

While Gates said that her ability to say no to powerful men, including J.M., spared her from the most degrading situations, others said they sometimes felt trapped in hotel rooms with power brokers who could make or break their careers.

Former competitor Amber Littlejohn, who now works as a lawyer in D.C., said the culture values compliance and punishes those who speak out. She said women in the sport find themselves ‚Äúripe for predation‚Äù because of the amount of money they invest and their dependence on the Manion family to succeed.

Jeweled posing bikinis can cost $1,000, and women reported spending thousands of dollars to compete.

‚ÄúI am not at all surprised by anything that can be said about these people, because I‚Äôve watched them do it for so long,‚Äù said Littlejohn, who posed one time in a bikini for J.M. ‚ÄúNothing has changed for the athletes. If anything, it‚Äôs gotten worse.‚Äù"
bodybuilding,"Officials of bodybuilding‚Äôs two premier federations have been sexually exploiting female athletes for decades ‚Äî pressuring them to pose for nude photographs, posting those photos to soft-core pornography sites, and, at times, manipulating contest results in favor of cooperative competitors, a Washington Post investigation has found.

For more than 15 years, J.M. Manion, whose father, Jim, has been running amateur and professional bodybuilding contests for decades, shot the photos and operated a network of paid soft-core pornography websites that at one point advertised ‚Äúover 30,000 images‚Äù of competitors in the sport. A Post review of website archives identified more than 200 female athletes in photos ranging from casual bikini shots to graphic, sexual images, including those of nude women together in beds, bathtubs and showers. One of J.M.'s sites, Fitness Divas, bluntly stated: ‚ÄúYour Favorite Fitness Athletes ‚Ä¶Naked!‚Äù

Jenn Gates, who won the figure category at the prestigious Olympia contest in 2008, graced the covers of fitness magazines and earned enough sponsorship money to quit her nursing job. Her manager, J.M., asked her to take off her bikini top and bottom for photos. Gates refused, and was surprised recently to learn from Post reporters that her swimsuit photos had been featured alongside nude female competitors on one of J.M.‚Äôs pornography sites.

‚ÄúI never consented to having my pictures put on a soft-porn site,‚Äù Gates said during an interview at her home in Indianapolis. Less than three years after winning the Olympia, Gates gave up the sport in disgust ‚Äî and warns young women to stay away from the contests.

Interviews with dozens of competitors, judges, officials and others connected to the sport reveal the systematic exploitation of female athletes often rendered vulnerable by extreme dieting and workouts, lack of financial stability and a drive to win. The Post found that some women believed their scores depended on their willingness to pose for sexual photos or to please the sport‚Äôs leading judges, promoters and managers, almost all of whom are male.

J.M. did not respond to questions The Post emailed him about the allegations. Rob Rosetti, a prominent trainer who sometimes attended the photo shoots for J.M.‚Äôs pornography websites, said the women had consented.

‚ÄúIn the very few photo shoots I was asked to attend, I witnessed no athlete being forced, pressured, persuaded, intimidated or coerced into posing nude by J.M. or any other individual assisting in the photo shoot,‚Äù Rosetti texted The Post.

‚ÄúIt was done completely on the athlete‚Äôs own free will,‚Äù he said.

A Washington Post investigation into a tip about the exploitation of women in bodybuilding led to the family that has dominated the sport for decades. This multipart series explores the family‚Äôs stewardship of the sport and the impact on the thousands of athletes who participate.

Mandy Henderson, a former sheriff‚Äôs deputy in Santa Clara County, Calif., detailed in an interview how the pressure was exerted on women. She agreed to nude photography with the expectation of winning a pro card, which allows athletes to move from amateur competitions to the professional league. A pro card can mean more money, sponsorships, and the chance to compete in the headlining competitions: the Arnold Classic and the Olympia.

At an amateur contest in 2009, she placed fourth and was surprised that it was taking so long for her to earn her pro card. When she asked why, she said, a prominent judge told her: ‚ÄúBecause you didn‚Äôt come to my room last night.‚Äù

Another athlete, who was at a shoot attended by Rosetti, described a ‚Äúhumiliating‚Äù experience in which J.M. told her to undress and enter a shower with two naked women to pose for photographs ‚Äî even though she‚Äôd previously told Rosetti she didn‚Äôt want to pose nude, said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. ‚ÄúI cannot tell you how terrible of an experience it was.‚Äù

Aly Garcia, a bikini competitor, said she refused to do the nude photos, and had to fend off advances from judges and promoters as gently as she could to keep her career alive. She abandoned the sport in 2017 when she concluded that she would never get a top win if she didn‚Äôt have sex with the power brokers. ‚ÄúThis is the only way I‚Äôm going to hit my goal?‚Äù she thought. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm not going to hit my goal.‚Äù

The leading amateur and professional federations are run by Jim Manion, J.M.‚Äôs father, a 78-year-old ex-bodybuilder, from his offices in Pittsburgh. Jim Manion presides over the amateur National Physique Committee (NPC) and the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness Pro League, known as the IFBB Pro League.

In response to a detailed query from The Post sent to Jim Manion, the two organizations issued a statement through Hammond Strategies, a crisis communications firm, but did not respond directly to any of the questions.

‚ÄúAs part of our efforts to grow the sport we have expanded events and opportunities for all competitors, grown prize purses for female athletes, and improved communications for our competitors to raise any concerns they may have with an event or their experience,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúWe address all concerns raised with the utmost care, concern, and timeliness.‚Äù

The statement said that more than half of registered competitors are women and that many shows feature all-female judging panels.

At bodybuilding‚Äôs biggest competitions, J.M. can be found front and center, his baseball cap worn backward as he snaps pictures of muscled competitors onstage. J.M. was a teenager when his father took the helm of bodybuilding‚Äôs newly created amateur organization. In 1977, with the release of the film ‚ÄúPumping Iron,‚Äù starring Schwarzenegger, bodybuilding exploded onto the public consciousness and spawned a fitness boom in the 1980s.

[How a Post reporter wound up investigating the sport his father made famous]

Bodybuilding is both a sport and an art form. Athletes sculpt their bodies through weight training and diet to compete in contests where they are judged on their muscular development after performing poses onstage. The sport has multiple categories based on weight classes and the degree of musculature, ranging from the most muscled (bodybuilding) to the lesser-built categories of figure and bikini. The latter two are for female athletes only.

Prize money is awarded to the top five winners in the pro contests. At the top of the game is the Olympia, with Mr. Olympia claiming a reported $675,000 last year, and Ms. Olympia just $60,000. Most of the hundreds of contests each year pay far less."
bodybuilding,I look better and I‚Äôm natural
bodybuilding,"Quite a diplomatic way to address that. Nats are definitely a thought crowd sometimes, and if you‚Äôre there to add ‚Äúnational competitor‚Äù to your bio, it‚Äôs the wrong place for it, in my opinion. I think people can compete in whatever shows they want, whether I think they‚Äôre ready or not, but your points are valid.

Also, you‚Äôve packed on some serious mass in your pics since Toronto, looking like you‚Äôll definitely turn some heads in FL."

bodybuilding,"Despite being brothers, it's interesting that your muscle development, possibly genetics differ quite a bit.

You look like more of a torso(chest, back) dominant bodybuilder, while your brother is limb(arms, shoulders, legs) dominant.

Anyways you both have great genetics/potential to become big in the sport!"
bodybuilding,I didn't specify dose dickhead. Don't put words in my mouth.
bodybuilding,"&gt;And the only people who are intereseted in those ""wins"" ... well its mostly only you and some other meatheads.

bodybuilding,And don't you think both factors play a big role on deteriorating somebody's health?
bodybuilding,I didn't know that homelander is also a bodybuilder
bodybuilding,Use it man. I talked to a heart doc about it after my dad passed and he explained how it puts extreme stress on the heart and causes dramatic spikes in blood pressure. With time it enlarges the heart and can cause a massive heart attack.
bodybuilding,"Are both around the same age ?
You seem to be around 23-24."
bodybuilding,I care more about the look of the imbalance than the strength imbalance.
bodybuilding,Do you have different bicep insertion/peak? That's an interesting point on genetic variation!
bodybuilding,That has more to do with acumulated damage rather than keep cycling.
bodybuilding,Thanks! I am hoping to get my legs evened out and build some glutes before I do a classic physique show in 2024. Goal is to blow away all my previous bests + maybe do well enough in a show to qualify for a national show and see where that goes...
bodybuilding,"He needs to get his lats to flair and get. Waisted as Samir would say.
Goes to show the differenence between IFBB and all others. He looks great on IG but he will get exposed of he makes it to the Mr. O. 
NOW, that is not to say he cant fix his lats and stomach and come nack in a year or 2 and amoke everyone! Obviously a genetic freak!"
bodybuilding,Cbum getting a documentary. Abt time
bodybuilding,Nice gyno brother.
bodybuilding,But at least with legs you can hide them a little bit.  It's hard to hide a bird chest.

bodybuilding,Tuov is the superior program
bodybuilding,"Big change in your delts, a lot more capped and rounded."
bodybuilding,If you think some first time user (bot me btw) doing 200-500mg of test for 12 weeks has the potential to drop dead at any time I don't know what to say other than I'm sorry your parents failed in educating you.
bodybuilding,"Nowhere have I said that lol, you're a moron. I said you'll still live a long relatively healthy life and outside of getting regular blood work, taking trt, and possibly something for your kidneys/blood pressure, not much is going to change. 

Fouad stopped taking competition levels of gear, he is on trt. He stopped because he was having kidney issues. As per his last dr visit his kidneys are back in a healthy*ish* state. 

Do you think hes going to drop dead by 50 because for 20+ years he was blasting?"
bodybuilding,Tremendous man! Well done. You can see you put in some serious work all year long.
bodybuilding,How does your leg workouts differ then?
bodybuilding,That's gotta be the ugliest outfit I've ever seen. Holy shit.
bodybuilding,Take things slow and have a plan for the entire prep! Don't use all your cards like cardio and drastic calorie drops/low carb etc straight from the get go. Take your time and take longer than you need and try to be ready before the show so you can test things and also eat into the show!

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
bodybuilding,"tbh, is ANY Amateur win worth it to reduce your lifespan by that amount? I doubt it. 

Even if you are a pro, look how many pros there are and how many are getting payed good and are well known.... not much.

bodybuilding,"Yep, he seems to have improved quite a lot from last year, and IMO he has one of the best balances between size and shape."
bodybuilding,Not the biggest fan of Hunter's physique but it seems like he can be much better this year. Weighs a lot more and his condition could still improve a ton.

bodybuilding,"Awful take , clearly from someone who has never done a prep or compete. You aren‚Äôt supposed to see drastic changes from week to week. The drastic change happens in the last week when you cut all the water retention from fatigue out and deload before the snow that‚Äôs when you‚Äôll see real  changes not from week 8-7, if his abs look like this now - on stage they will be deep as fuck come 6 weeks when he cuts water and adds tan and show shine ‚ú®"

bodybuilding,"Yes, he is on the right. And his legs are next level."
bodybuilding,"&gt;but I‚Äôm trying to have a basic sense of what I should expect.

IMO you shouldn't be expecting anything, but focus on learning, and following a plan that will drive your progress, that's what will guarantee that you get the best possible results."
bodybuilding,"&gt;I'm afraid that something bad is gonna happen if I ego lift

It can happen. Constantly maxing out is pointless, unless you're training with powerlifting goals, your 1RM is irrelevant, you should already be progressing weights over time in your day to day sets, that's also getting stronger. 

And please don't use smelling salts to squat 4 plates lol."
bodybuilding,I have a feeling that Hunter will be placing higher than Nick this year.

Do wonder though, is there any tall natural lifter in this sub? Am about 1,97m tall, so just under 6'6. I see a lot of people around the 5'8/5'11 height, but can't seem to find some tall guys to 'compare' to. I would love to know where I'd stand with my height and weight"

Can anybody honestly tell me with a straight face that even absolute icons in the sport like Ronnie Coleman looked good? 

I'm just repeating what many others are thinking. I like the sport, and the dedication it takes tonl get to that level, but these guys don't look fucking good at all. They look like abominations that modern science and a culture of body dysmorphia have allowed. 

I am not claiming to have the answers to the problem, but where else can the sport go besides back to a more realistic, and actually eye pleasing physique?

bodybuilding,I fucking love PPL. I fucking LOVE PPL. I FUCKING LOVE PPL. I FUC-
bodybuilding,"&gt; I‚Äôm trying to have a basic sense of what I should expect

Expect that your upper body is going to be way behind your lower body, and your quads are going to be ahead of everything. 

One thing you can try to address this is implementing a biweekly 321 PPL program focused on the upper body. For example,

Week A: Push / Pull / Push / Pull / Legs / Push (3 Push, 2 Pull, 1 Legs)

Week B: Push / Pull / Push / Pull / Legs / Pull  (2 Push, 3 Pull, 1 Legs)

Over the course of a 12 week macrocycle, a standard PPL program: P/P/L/P/P/L or some cyclic permutation of this, will provide a total volume of,

24 Push / 24 Pull / 24 Legs 

A biweekly 321 program would help you get out of the gate fast because it takes half of the standard amount of leg volume, and gives it to the upper body instead. So, over the course of 12 weeks, you'd be getting,

30 Push / 30 Pull / 12 Legs

This might look like not enough legs, but factoring in cardio, e.g., exercise bike, stairmaster , or running, and sneaking in calf raises at the end of non-adjacent push days it's actually more than you might think, and the extra Push and Pull sessions will bring up your upper body fast."

I did squat 285lbs for 4 sets of 5, and I was in a good mood aka feeling hype, so I went for 315 (i failed the max out 5 months ago and did not max out since), and then went for 365. I got 365 as my new PR now, but considering how I fatigued my legs before the PR ( 4 working sets and 1 set of 315 for 1), do you think that I could get 405? I didn't use pre or smelling salt before the lift, but I'm not sure if those things make a difference  
I really want to try it right now, but I'm afraid that something bad is gonna happen if I ego lift. Should I give it another month or 2, maybe even 3?"
bodybuilding,People don‚Äôt typically just die overnight from not wearing a CPAP. Sleep apnea is more likely to cause more chronic conditions as opposed to sudden death during sleep.
bodybuilding,"Technically, I came to the conclusion that he is and has been cycling for years‚Äîso it *is* judging. But common usage connotes a negative bias or opinion when I have none.

bodybuilding,"ah, my bad, thanks"
bodybuilding,Holy fuck I'm weak
bodybuilding,"I‚Äôm making the jump into bodybuilding from cycling (F). I‚Äôve had off and on lifting experience over the last 7 years.

bodybuilding,"He could still be dosing like the bigger guys though and just not achieve that level of size because of genetics. Human organs are not built to filter/process that level of chemicals. As others have said, the poor guys organs were probably exhausted by the time he hit his 40s."

bodybuilding,"I know its only October, but if you aint making protein shakes with egg nog already, are you really even trying to bulk?"
bodybuilding,"Honestly just choose one. Your volume and intensity will be directly tied to how you‚Äôre splitting things up. So either the optional 5th day will be fluff and you program it so you‚Äôre making the most of your recovery capacity in the 4 days, or the 4 day weeks you‚Äôll be doing less than you can just in case of a 5th day."
bodybuilding,I haven't actually come up with a routine yet but tomorrow I just plan to do incline crutches and weighted crunches.

bodybuilding,How many weeks out are you from addressing that gyno?

bodybuilding,Shoulders are looking round!!!! Good shit
bodybuilding,"It forever alters your hormone levels sure, but the fact that dudes like Arnold, Tom Platz, Dorian, Kevin Levrone, Ronnie, and Lee Haney among others who had nowhere near the knowledge, research, or peer experience to draw from are all living out long healthy lives (Ronnie's injuries have zero relation to peds) should tell you there is nuance.

And if you assume anytime a bodybuilder passes away it was anabolics you are autistic."
bodybuilding,"Looking lean asf.

As a morbidly obese kid, now just an overweight adult, you guys are inspiring! Don't let yourself become fat lol trust me!"
bodybuilding,Lat is where it‚Äôs at.  Nice work

bodybuilding,Fuuuaaark brah
bodybuilding,"Does anyone have any ideas of what I could do for a 4 day bodybuilding split, but with an optional 5th day. So like the first 4 days would be the main program, and then the 5th day would be something that‚Äôs not crucial to the integrity of the program, but also something that when done isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúfluff and pump‚Äù bs waste of time workout. Sometimes I feel like lifting 5 days a week, sometimes 4, so I feel like this could be a good middle ground, I just don‚Äôt know how to set it up"
bodybuilding,"Bro the chest ripples are so fucking sick, absolutely gains points from the judges. Also, the transition from back to front when u point to the side is awesome. Great job big dawg"
bodybuilding,Alot better more seperation and tighter for sure.. Posing is solid
bodybuilding,Reading this comment section gave me a brain aneurysm
bodybuilding,He holds fat in his back. There is a dramatic difference in the lower back especially week to week though. About 2 weeks out I think you'll notice a huge change
bodybuilding,"Ate a shit ton of carbs yesterday and ran 9.5 miles in 61 minutes. Not bad in my eyes, the run felt easy too, could‚Äôve pushed it tbh but I decided to take it easy"

bodybuilding,"What a load of shit, anything outside of trt will have negative consequences"
bodybuilding,But IF you woke up tomorrow and suddenly looked like this would you be like ‚Äúoh no‚Äù or ‚Äúhell yeah‚Äù?
bodybuilding,you could train negatives but depending on the lift you need spotters to lift it off you
bodybuilding,"I‚Äôve had blood work, exercise stress test, heart echo, and 2 EKGs. Doc said everything looked great. Never had a sleep test, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not an issue. My dad was not health conscious at all to say the least so that was definitely a factor."

bodybuilding,How much do you weigh here? Your overall frame for 6 feet tall is ridiculously impressive. I don't care what it took and what you put in your body to obtain this physique. At 23 years old you have made it and should be proud of yourself
bodybuilding,Bingo
bodybuilding,"NPC Weight 212lb
IFBB Weight 222lb
I weighed in at check ins at 208lb probably on stage about 213-214"
bodybuilding,lol

Your 16 weeks out photos, not a lot of change at all.

Your 7 week fasted photos look the best imo"
bodybuilding,Roid rage.  Also lots of studies seems to show that it affects the heart and blood pressure long term.  43 is pretty young and if his cardiac system was destroyed over time is it really worth it?
bodybuilding,Never seen a forearm have such an angle like that before. Theyre huge in comparison to his wrist size too.
bodybuilding,At least they use the number to help you out lol.
bodybuilding,"I don't understand what people see in Nick.

First his personality. The guy dumb as fuck, not funny, brought 0value to the podcast basically just took the place from someone that could contribute to the conversation.

Second his physique a fucking refrigerator. Widest midsection from all, a big block. Even ramy at 300+ pounds looks more aesthetic than Nick. It's just horrible to look at him. If he ever wins the O I will give up watching open for ever.

There are so many guy with much better personalities and/or physiques yet nick seems to have the biges fanbase in open. I can't understand."
bodybuilding,Just need a bit more size and you‚Äôll be competing for pro wins. You‚Äôve got the structure. Curious how much room you have to grow though? Stage weight at this last comp?
bodybuilding,Enlarged heart perhaps. Iirc you can drop all the weight you want but an enlarged heart is forever.

I enjoy this hobby and following bodybuilding, but sometimes I'm kind of happy I'm just some amateur who's not really looking for huge success and attention with inevitable gear use.

 The couple of pros I know IRL who came off and lost most of their size for ""health reasons"" did so because of kidney failure and heart damage that forced them to stop mega dosing, and even then they kept on doing TRT+ doses

This guy looks like he came off everything and stopped lifting so I assume it was some serious health condition?"
bodybuilding,Not surprised by the down votes on reddit despite the massive amount of evidence that it adversely affects the heart.
bodybuilding,"Cant argue that. Even the lil munchkin judge on muscle n fitness podcast said the same thing. ""Very conservative"" on the changing of the top guys is exactly what he said and he is a judge so...."

It's so awkwardly sappy, especially since it feels like 80% of those are just moms complaining about the kids or spouse.  It feels so fake.

I've been happily employed as a software developer for almost a year now and am much more content with life. I couldn't see myself being happy 10/20/30 years down the line doing what I was doing. If you aren't happy now, definitely make a switch of some sort. It isn't going to get better, and it is never too late to switch careers.   
 I got lucky with programming because I kind of went for it with no alternative career in mind. There was no 'lightbulb' moment where I knew software development was for me, but it was something that excited me so I jumped at it. It worked out for me because I ended up both loving it and getting a position that compensated similarly my attorney salary, but that won't be the case for everyone who switches careers. That being said, being content and fulfilled with what I do for work really improved my life in every aspect. Good luck brother"
bodybuilding,"And he still won't take any new angles for his pictures :/

Your S2W is great. But you can't highlight your ""physique"" with a Relaxed Pose from an overly close spot - positioned at your midsection"
bodybuilding,"Drop weight and add reps and lengthen your tempo till your failure looks and feels like what you feel like it should be. If you're going from I can do this rep no prob, to i can't complete the rep, but your muscle isn't on fire, then it's too heavy for what your going for."
bodybuilding,Did you switch fields when you went to grad school or just get a higher degree in the field you were in? Kids and money aren‚Äôt a huge priority right now since I‚Äôm single AF and have a reasonable amount of savings from my early career.
bodybuilding,"Is $1200 for three months for training a good deal, average, or ripoff? Never had a coach before any help is appreciated!"
bodybuilding,"&gt; Don't get me started on DH (dear hubby) 

oh my

fucking god"
bodybuilding,Biggest 145lbs I‚Äôve ever seen
bodybuilding,"The mom subreddits use ""FTM"" for first time mom. Reading it, you'd think Female-to-Male, sometimes I read it as ""full time"" mom. 

But yeah parenting groups have the most acronyms. Don't get me started on DH (dear hubby) or BD (baby dance - you're adults, just say sex)"
bodybuilding,"It should need more, bc you see idiots who are 19 on the sub taking gear. Had an argument about why taking diuretics is stupid unless you have hypertension."
bodybuilding,"must another heart defect that litters only bodybuilders, couldn't be the aggressive drug use"
bodybuilding,Me thinks you crushed the competition. Abs are razored.
bodybuilding,"To be honest I had to get to a point where I despised both jobs I tried in the field I was in. Grad school was a substantial financial hit (6 year PhD) but to be honest I enjoy where I'm at now so I don't mind. It would be different if I had a kid or wanted to save up for a down payment, I saw many people leave grad school for those reasons."
bodybuilding,Derek is that u??
bodybuilding,"Ich wuensche ihm Ruhe in Frieden.

bodybuilding,"Don't worry, we're sadly catching up lol. At least we'll always have walkable cities tho."
bodybuilding,"Because it takes time, your body needs to get skilled at different exercises, and that's a really slow process."
bodybuilding,our culture is terminally online and amazingly lazy :(
bodybuilding,"I mean yeah, but like I've seen ‚Äúgoing to failure‚Äù and mine just ain't it. I know every person has a different till-failure, but I could do better than what I'm experiencing now."
bodybuilding,"I pity the OLD SPICE ODOR BLOCKER BODY WASH

bodybuilding,Eat more calories to get bigger/r/gainit might give you some meal ideas
bodybuilding,You.. Don't? That's the definition of going to failure.
bodybuilding,Can you tell us how you really feel?
bodybuilding,"Are you aware of what the words ""Push"" and ""Pull"" mean in common english?"
bodybuilding,Does anyone know how I can lift more than my body allows me? Like my arms suddenly don't cooperate with me halfway though the rep. I'm guessing they're weak asf.
bodybuilding,"Poke your hips out for CP, look at Ruffin or cbum"
bodybuilding,"Yea true, i was kinda more referencing some of the bigger IFBB guys out there right now"
bodybuilding,"No advice, but you are looking good. It is crazy how muscular you are in comparison to myself. I have lbm of 182 at about 6'1"" and have nowhere near the muscle volume you do, even under the fat haha. Crazy how proportions can alter how we carry weight."
bodybuilding,Youre eating way too much chicken brother
bodybuilding,"You look suck my friend, best of luck."
bodybuilding,So you're telling me taking some capsules from REVIVE MD won't prevent me from dropping dead after years of blasting and food abuse?
bodybuilding,Casual cycling pairs excellently with body building... its high intensity stuff that is detrimental.

bodybuilding,"You‚Äôre looking a lot more drier this time round, good work. Best of luck for your show."
bodybuilding,"Yah I have had one for years, and you DEFINITELY need to use it. You are depriving your brain of oxygen killing yourself slowly over time by destroying brain cells. You are basically killing your brain by not using it. You get used to it so start using it! You will prob feel more rested also after a few weeks you should notice improvement in energy levels."
bodybuilding,"It's a very dangerous game. Prolly not worth it if you have people that care about you. With that said, who am I to judge a man on a pursuit of his dreams (considering he's not doing harm to anyone else)?"
bodybuilding,Yah make sure you don't have it passed down from genetics. The machines sometimes are covered by insurance or possibly most of the time. I have one and it's a blessing for better sleep and recovery.
bodybuilding,"Hunter is overrated as fuck.

Andrew is maybe 8th at best."
bodybuilding,Clearly I‚Äôm joking.. he looks like he has a backpack on each leg ü´¢
bodybuilding,Damn. I have sleep apnea and I never wear my machine because I hate it. Guess I better get used to it.
bodybuilding,I don t see where i Ve written that he had a bad physique üòïüòï
bodybuilding,"Without a source to cite, I‚Äôd say that is indeed the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù version (yours). ‚ÄúMine‚Äù is just the slang version, and I‚Äôd never use it in formal writing or think it‚Äôs by any means correct grammar. I should‚Äôve probably tacked that on for clarity."
bodybuilding,"No background doggo this time, downvoted.

JK, you look noticeably tighter, good luck for the next show!"
bodybuilding,"For what I've seen, it's a very American thing, back when I was working on a project with a client over there, they also used acronyms constantly. A friend that's working there (he's from Spain like me) also noticed it, and now uses them too lol"
bodybuilding,I do it at the end if of every other workout. I have slight ab lines at 215 lbs too
bodybuilding,I know 1 thing for sure...I will be watching it on the live stream again this year! If you ask me to pick top 5 I would give you 11 names!

bodybuilding,lol chill. Didn‚Äôt realize and now I do. Don‚Äôt get too butthurt pal
bodybuilding,This dude was way smaller though
bodybuilding,My dad has sleep apnea so bad he had to get a tracheotomy. It caused his blood pressure to skyrocket and caused literal pain to where he was diagnosed with spinal stenosis. Turned out he had the 1% sleep apnea where you can die at any time in your sleep. A cpap helped but the trach made the pain and other issues stop. He even dropped 50 pounds afterwards without trying.
bodybuilding,Interesting. That‚Äôs exciting then
bodybuilding,"He‚Äôs enhanced, proven drug abuser in profile history"
bodybuilding,"""That's my secret, Cap. I never had biglegs."""
bodybuilding,"One thing I find really funny about a lot of online discussions is the heavy use of acronyms. Like I've seen people use ""OLD"" to mean ""online dating."" Or on this sub people have talked about their diets on TD/NTD which I had to figure out meant training day/non-training day.

On r/nba [this became a huge running joke when people refer to obscure players by their initials](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kpaw7d/can_we_please_stop_calling_players_that_90_of/) .

I've also heard that on forums for moms, they use initials/acronyms for EVERYTHING like TTC (trying to conceive) And even ""POAS"" which means ""peeing on a stick"" aka a home pregnancy test."
bodybuilding,Dude I thought there was something behind your forearm or something making it look that big but no. Holy fucking shit goddamn that‚Äôs unreal I have never seen that. Not even in comic books lol
bodybuilding,Happy to help! A lot of BBers avoid training abs because of the whole waistline thing but that‚Äôs a myth. A strong TVA and ab routine will help with deep cuts/separation but will also help you tighten up your core and pull the waist in. This was one of the things that helped Roelly and currently helps Nick W
bodybuilding,Lats and biceps are lacking for sure!!! Never trained abs in my life so really going to focus on these little key points this off season! Thank you!
bodybuilding,Solid work üí™üèº
bodybuilding,Have you seen Derek Lunsford lately ?
bodybuilding,"I‚Äôd say lats, arms and abs. Abs look a little flat. Lats to help the taper and arms to look proportional."
bodybuilding,Where's the leg pics.
bodybuilding,It's really up to you. Why do you workout? Cuz it's fun? or are you trying to be a serious competitor? I realized I'm in the first category so decided I'll go biking/hiking/ whatever fun cardio things I want on my off days and if it ruins my leg workout who cares
bodybuilding,Damn you look great‚Ä¶. Sexy as
bodybuilding,What show are you doing ?
bodybuilding,You've been talking about it for a while. Take some kind of plunge. I went from electrical work to nursing and I love it
bodybuilding,Getting a big enough chest that it doesn‚Äôt matter
bodybuilding,"For sure.  You look great.  Your waist?! ü§åüèΩ!  Definitely would need to pack on some more size for wellness; like you said in due time but that‚Äôs the great thing about the off season‚Ä¶.. With each one, the gainz just get better and better.  I‚Äôve been contemplating coming out of retirement from NPC Figure and possibly giving NPC Wellness a go.  Just kind of playing around with the idea at the moment.  I live the lifestyle regardless."
bodybuilding,I really like Alpha Lion's Super Human Pump.
bodybuilding,Shoot your shot I guess
bodybuilding,I have a small tear in my shoulder and can‚Äôt really do much upper body stuff especially on that side. Time to go all in on legs for awhile!
bodybuilding,"Definitely look way more lean, great job!!!!"
bodybuilding,"Bikini! It would be cool to be able to compete in wellness one day, with time."
bodybuilding,I can see a difference for sure.  With each show is the chance to get better and better!  Looks like you understood the assignment!  Are you doing bikini or wellness?
bodybuilding,My dad passed away in his sleep and he had really bad sleep apnea that was never treated. He was 43 years old. Haunts me everyday.
bodybuilding,üòÇ still jacked. I‚Äôll take it
bodybuilding,Thanks brother. That means a lot!
bodybuilding,he won my heart already &lt;3
bodybuilding,"No, I did find the guy though. Funny enough a number of his posts were banned/deleted leading up to his show. He did alright,3rd place in his class in classic physique. His conditioning definitly could have been better. And seeing the stage shots really showed his weaknesses compared to his reddit posts."

bodybuilding,"Hey friends! Posted here a while ago before my 1st show, didn‚Äôt go my way but I‚Äôm super grateful because I‚Äôm coming into this show with a good mindset that I just want to be happy with the work I‚Äôve done. It‚Äôs hard as hell not comparing yourself to other people in this sport. Working out is the easy part some days, but it‚Äôs me Vs. me this time!"

bodybuilding,Thank you! Yes this go around I‚Äôm going to hire a posing coach just to help me perfect my poses I know they are far from perfect!! But yes this off season legs and arms are the main focus points!
bodybuilding,"Same here. Rice and ground chicken with Siracha on top, mix it up, add in spinach, and then try to get some spinach meat and rice all in one bite"
bodybuilding,"I think you look great ! I would add a little twist to the front double to make the waist look a little more narrow and maybe turn in the elbows a little more to pop the triceps out a bit more? 
Some more glutes and hams would go a long way to complete that insane back shot !"
bodybuilding,Looking good!
bodybuilding,"Doing long term high dose anabolics is simply very unhealthy for you. ‚ÄúBut you can do it safely with proper timing and cycling‚Äù. Sure, but you almost certainly affect your health and/or life expectancy. That being said, maybe it‚Äôs worth it for the sick gains."
bodybuilding,where do you see Rami?
bodybuilding,Samson Dauda and Andrew Jacked are
bodybuilding,"I don‚Äôt know the specifics, but a quick Google search shows [this for example](https://www.awdts.com.au/hair-follicle-steroids-testing)."
bodybuilding,"I agree on hunter and Hadi, Andrew I'm skeptical if he can make that conditioning based on his latest show."
bodybuilding,You will be dead in no time !
bodybuilding,Thanks. Interesting! Can they get rid of it before the contest?
bodybuilding,Lol you really don‚Äôt have hunter there when he place top 4 ? And he‚Äôs only better this year. Also William beat Brandon at Arnold he‚Äôs working with chad - he will damage the top 5.
bodybuilding,"I didn‚Äôt downvote, so will it show some unique marker or can you tell the levels from the follicle?"
bodybuilding,Might help or not. Losing weight Will also help with sleep apnea but the gear has Long lasting damage that cant be reversed
bodybuilding,Tight as a drum bro. Flex those abs and you‚Äôll knock the judges.
powerlifting,"Do y'alls lower backs get sore from sumo deadlift? I took a deload maybe two weeks ago and I'm not sure if my technique changed coming back from the one week deload but sumo has been making my lower back more sore than usual, haven't really changed much consciously I believe. Maybe form is off now? Seems pretty similar to my old setup. 

[top single from yesterday](https://streamable.com/g2t191)

[single from ab a month ago](https://youtu.be/9bDp-Gg85Jc)"
powerlifting,genuinely no idea but one of the example projects was about ‚Äúextreme‚Äù subculture so i rolled w it
powerlifting,So sorry. I mean leading up to the comp. I have a comp in July and I am determined to get 500kg total. I just don't know if better to aim for eg 180 100 220 or to aim for 500 total and see what it takes to get there
powerlifting,"Haha, well I can't help with those then. I would otherwise love to help, and am kind of curious how this is anthropology vs sociology or psychology."
powerlifting,Just gain a bunch of weight. 5 pounds a week MINIMUM until you hit your goals. I'd say 6 months if you can put on 100 pounds.
powerlifting,Just upgraded to a 10mm Inzer lever belt from a shitty 5mm belt I got on Amazon when I first started. Never realized what I‚Äôve been using was only 5mm.. wondering if there will be a noticeable difference?
powerlifting,"Many roads lead to Rome. It sort of depends on the type of lifter that you are. Either way will potentially get you there but one is a methodical approach and one is more of a YOLO approach. I have some lifters who would shit themselves if we didn't have all 3 attempts (and 2-3 backup attempts) planned a month in advanced while others who would fire me if I tried to be that planned with them. 

Option 1 lets you go HAM but leaves you more open to missing the desired total or having to pull a huge deadlift to make up for any unsuccessful attempts. The second option is more likely to guarantee a total but has the potential to hold you back from performing at your absolute best on the day.

I like a hybrid strategy of picking a minimum total that is likely achievable on 2nds and then leaving 3rds for YOLO or to retry a missed attempt on 2nds."
powerlifting,They also tend to wear deadlift suits
powerlifting,"Last session Thursday, competition day Saturday

Last heavy day? The Saturday before it"
powerlifting,"I would encourage you to sit at this new weight for a while before starting the cut. You'll continue gaining strength and help lock those gains in as more than just leverage changes.

It feels like a long time, especially if you are a bit fatter than you feel comfortable being, but in the grand scheme of things fat is lost pretty easily."
powerlifting,"Do you have collars on? The plates shouldn't move much f you have the plates tightly together and the collars on. A lower quality bar might whip with heavier weight but the plates shouldn't. 

Exploding as hard as possible through the ROM is exactly what you want to do so don't stop that"
powerlifting,the interview could be a zoom thing but i also would like to join for the lifting session so i can have participant observation yk
powerlifting,Do you have to be local or can you do a zoom type interview?
powerlifting,"damn, thx, i‚Äôll do that, you‚Äôre right about the injury and burnout, i just didn‚Äôt realize how much i loved lifting till now because i used to lift for fun in high school but never for competition, and i feel like i need to make up for lost time, but i‚Äôll be more careful with my expectations"
powerlifting,"I know what you're going for and honestly I respect it, but I think you should set your goals high if you must and keep your expectations more in line with reality.  That way, you don't put all your emotional eggs in the basket of ""3pl8 bench within 1 year or bust"" and either a) push too hard and injure yourself, or b) burn out.  Any veteran of this sport, myself included, can tell you a million stories of newbies like yourself who have taken both routes.    
By separating your goals from your expectations, you can take advice from seasoned lifters to manage the latter, while still having goals that motivate you and could, if you turn out to be prodigious, become reality."
powerlifting,"Interesting, thanks!"
powerlifting,Got it. The dilemma of trying to force more quad usage by getting my knees more forward/out versus embracing my naturally half-stiff-legged deadlift comes up. Time to try and find out. Thanks!
powerlifting,"I would say in an untrained person the classic ""squat the weight up"" comes to mind.  In a trained person I would say probably just lower hip position to start which isn't exactly bad..... You'll know if you aren't using your posterior chain effectively simply by the fact that your deadlift will suck"
powerlifting,"and yeah i understand i should manage my expectations but i keep these stupid high expectations so that when i do get short of them, I still make a shit ton of progress"
powerlifting,"LMAO nah i don‚Äôt mean i don‚Äôt want to listen to others but I need to speed up the process without risking any injury, and i was just wondering what other people thot, now obviously bench is gonna take like 1-2 years to get to 315 but idk how possible it is for squat and deadlift to get to 400 and 500"
powerlifting,"I can tell you that it took me five years of lifting and three of competing in powerlifting to bench 300 lb in your weight class.  I'm not the most talented lifter by a long shot and my training could have been improved in hindsight, so it's certainly possible to improve faster than I did, but I don't think I'm a shoo-in of a baseline to blow away.    
In your other replies, you openly state say you don't have the patience to wait long and seemingly want to reach all these goals in under a year.  You also state you don't want to listen to people who tell you otherwise.  You might turn out to be a prodigy, but if not, I strongly suggest you manage your expectations."
powerlifting,"&gt;Generally speaking, how would an anterior dominant person's deadlift look compared to a posterior dominant one's? My guess would be that anterior dominant would be more of a weightlifter pull where quads do ton of work

 I soundly fall into the ""anterior dominant"" archetype and I find my strength on quad-driven, clean-pull-esque deadlifts in 22mm heels roughly comparable to ""proper"" deadlifts in flats (maybe a bit more comfortable, even?).

Granted, I'm not great at deads, nor are my proportions. But... yeah. I've actually thought ""shit, why not just do these weird clean pulls instead"" here and there."
powerlifting,"Not in that area myself but, I recommend looking for a barbell club or powerlifting gym in your area and starting there if you don't get any bites via this thread."
powerlifting,"Gotcha. Wedging a 6'7 330lbs frame into a deadlift must be awkward to say the least. 

Reading through the replies I realized that it was probably them trying to cue me into using a more quad-dominant deadlift (similar to WL pulls) since my legs look big compared to my waist."
powerlifting,[Hit this pause double @155kg and just wanted to share.](https://streamable.com/h13ht1) It‚Äôs not super impressive but I personally am pretty happy to see myself progress and my form improve over time
powerlifting,"Generally speaking, how would an anterior dominant person's deadlift look compared to a posterior dominant one's? My guess would be that anterior dominant would be more of a weightlifter pull where quads do ton of work while posterior dominant would be more similar to mine (high hips, hammies/erectors doing most of the work)

I tried it and I felt much, much slower off the floor, wasn't sure if it was just taking a getting used to, or if it was just not good advice for me. Guess it's the latter then."
powerlifting,When I was on crutches/no weight bearing on my left knee after surgery I did a lot of feet up benching etc but I didn't factor in all the additional strain on my triceps from being on crutches all day and I started to get the world's worst tendonitis.  Arms were jacked doe
powerlifting,"This.   I see it mostly with fatter lifters that can‚Äôt get into a proper starting position because of their stomach size.   
I used to pull back a bit and then I fell with 505 near lockout and almost destroyed my legs.   I stick with pulling straight up now."
powerlifting,"Mentally trying to lift the bar ""back"" instead of ""up"" will help you use your posterior chain a little better if you're one of those people that are more anterior dominant.  It's just a mental queue though, shouldn't change the actual bar path."
powerlifting,I think strongman have to use different methods of positioning themselves cause of their sheet size. Might work for you but it's not required
powerlifting,"With those numbers, your squat and deadlift should increase pretty quickly. (I went from never deadlifting to pulling 405 in maybe 6 months).   
Bench tends to move a bit slower.  
A lot of the progress depends on how well you structure training, how much time you spend working on form, willingness to gain weight, willingness to take peds, etc."
powerlifting,"""Sitting/falling back into a deadlift""?

I see some strongmen do this and it's something my (stronger, ex-competitors included) friends recommended to me. 

The point is that you get into your usual starting position, pull slack, then instead ofstanding up with the bar, you kind of fulcrum back with it, as if you were trying to fall back, therefore not pulling it directly up, but a bit diagonally (obviously if shins weren't blocking that) so you could get away with your shoulders being a bit behind the bar. Supposedly it should help you get more legs into the pull. Is there some truth to this? I've never seen any guide mention this, but then again, my way of explaining it is complicated as is, maybe I just never understood."
powerlifting,The 16 week Calgary program is great.  Put like 50-60 on my squat and 20ish on my bench.   Haven‚Äôt pulled a DL max since running it but it definitely increased too
powerlifting,"When squatting is it normal for the plates to shake/whip at the top? I've been working on being more explosive, but I feel like I hit the top at the plates make a ton of noise and the bar starts whipping, especially at lower weights when warming up. I'm guessing I could pull the bar tighter with my lats, but wondering if I'm developing a bad habit by exploding as hard as possible and destabilizing the bar."
powerlifting,"[Hit a new squat PR of 425lbs today!](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkJVYyaAdAI/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)

I'm really happy about this lift. I was going for 420 today and it felt so good I decided to bump it up a little bit."
powerlifting,"Yeah, I see where you're coming from. The boom of PL on socials skewed the demography a bit. Dudes on Tiktok who kick the shit out of the bar before pulling 500 followed by throwing their belt across the whole crowded gym get millions of views while EliteFTS is barely getting by."
powerlifting,Thanks! Bonus because its free
powerlifting,"[Hit a 10 lb deadlift PR today](https://imgur.com/a/lcTTzkJ)


I never even got 375 above my knees on my bulk, so it feels nice to hit it almost a whole month into the cut. Shout out to El Toro‚Äôs Taco Tuesday for fueling me before the session today ü´°"
powerlifting,"Is it better to aim for a total, or aim for a specific weight in each lift to achieve that total?"
powerlifting,It's the longevity aspect. Can I add 50lbs to my squat within 3 months but that progress may be too fast for the connective tissues to catch up with. Or should I add 75lbs to my squat in a year and be healthy enough for more progress the next year? We're in a generation where people see the hear and now. The concept of delayed satisfaction is few and far between. To each their own but the strongest lifelong totals are the ones who lift the longest. Burn out rate is very very high
powerlifting,"Interesting, I've been under the impression that the tejas is the industry standard and the buki is starting to poke its head in"
powerlifting,I compete in USPA. The rules just say the bar has to be 20kg and between 27mm and 32mm in thickness. I‚Äôve done meets with a power bar and deadlift bar. Just depends on the meet director. I also compete in strongman and they love the deadlift bar.
powerlifting,"I've never seen a sanctioned meet use the rogue, are you american?"
powerlifting,"Cerakote bars have very limiter grip compared to steel finished

Texas is the most common and used universally in meets"
powerlifting,Get on a good program and that's completely possible
powerlifting,I've heard a lot of people recommend Calgary barbell 8 or 16 week (really depends on how long you want). I've ran the 8 week one and found it pretty good
powerlifting,"Honestly if I didn't have the distraction of my favorite lift (squat) and my love of deadlifting heavy singles, I'd probably try to go full bodybuilding with just my upper body. It'd be all dummbbell and cable work and Rich Piana 8 hour arm workouts trying to get as jacked as humanly possible."
powerlifting,"Hey I've only trained starting strength, the texas method, and 5/3/1 my whole life and have made progress but I've also heard on this subreddit that these aren't actually powerlifting programs. What would you suggest as a first powerlifting program?"
powerlifting,"oh damn, i don‚Äôt got time for that, imagine if I increase 150lb on everything in 6 months lol"
powerlifting,"""DEADLIFT ONLY, NO RACK PULLS!!!"" On white tape wrapped around the sleeve collar"
powerlifting,Just started squatting again.
powerlifting,Gotten your squat and/or deadlift mostly back though?
powerlifting,"I've been through two cycles of this, and honestly I didn't do too much different from what I would have while squatting and deadlifting. Pushing bench volume much higher just wasn't sustainable for my shoulders.

I haven't yet returned to competition, so I don't have a lot to offer in that regard."
powerlifting,Best case scenario (optimal recovery and training) it'll take a year-1.5year at least
powerlifting,I think what he means is using the pads to put your foot on so you can split squats
powerlifting,"Mad BroScientists of r/powerlifting: if you broke your knee, how would you maximize upper body gains while it healed?

  
I fractured my tibia a few days ago, still waiting on an MRI but it seems likely I've torn my LCL and may need surgery. I'm gonna be off work for a while with very little to do except eat, rest, and beat the absolute brakes off of my apartment gym.

  
I'm already planning to really push Larsen press hard so I come back to a big bench, but I find myself in kind of a unique position - I have all the time in the world and can do basically as much volume as I can recover from, which should be a LOT considering (a) I'm not doing anything except lifting and bed rest and (b) I'm not gonna be able to do anything with my lower body for at least a month or two.

  
I have a good selection of dumbbells, a barbell, cage and adjustable bench, two cable stacks, a chin up bar, a chest/shoulder press and a machine pulldown. I'm getting around with a walker and a brace right now and have no problem sitting down and standing up, but I can't really bend that leg or put any weight on it, so I'm planning on doing lots of feet-up pressing, and I'm leaning towards a high-volume approach in general.  
Treat me like your guinea pig: what would you do if you were me? I'd also love rehab advice from anyone who's had a similar injury and returned to competition afterwards."
powerlifting,"i‚Äôm tryna compete for powerlifting, along with that, with my squat and deadlify"
powerlifting,I see a lot of different opinions but generally how many days do you leave before last training day and competition day? if any prefers to do only cardio in those days? Just curious as I‚Äôm approaching my first comp
powerlifting,"The standard answer is it depends. You're going to keep going up because of newbie gains, then if you factor in anatomy it changes it again. If you're built to do one of the 3 lifts, it's likely going to increase faster than the others. Is there a reason you are trying to expedite the process?"
powerlifting,Thank you!!!!
powerlifting,"Personal preference, I think the Kabuki is the best bar but it's so cost prohibitive I'd go with a Texas or Rogue. Okies come bare steel so you would have to do maintenance to prevent rusting compared to a bar with any sort of coating on the shaft. We do the colored tape thing with signs and it works for the most part."
powerlifting,"Hey I‚Äôm tryna improve my total as quickly as possible. I‚Äôm at 75kg so I‚Äôm trying to improve my bench squat and deadlift by 150lbs each. Bench is at 155, squat is at 245 and deadlift is at 355. How long do you guys think it will take me to improve each of these by 150 pounds. I should also mention i started lifting seriously like two months ago and started focusing on powerlifting like 3 weeks ago"
powerlifting,"Assuming the meet is on saturday, for squat I would do something like 3 singles at 80% plus 3x5 at 60%  on monday, one single at 80% plus 3x3 at 60% on wednesday.

For bench, 3x2 at 80% plus 2x6 at 70% on monday, and 82,5% for a single plus 3x3 at 70% on wednesday.

For deadlift, a triple on 57,5%, 65% and 72,5% on monday. Rest for the two days last days leading into the meet."
powerlifting,"Do any ladies here use menstrual cups or discs? 

I have used a cup for years but have issues with it moving around when I brace for squat or deadlift. I've just bought a disc and am trying it out but hopefully having it sit higher is better? Would like to hear if anyone else has used a disc and if you have issues with bracing/movement."
powerlifting,I think in USPA with the recent weight class changes you may get your wish in the next few years. I think there were probably women holding themselves to the 90s so that they didn‚Äôt have to compete in the 90+ classes weighing 95 against someone walking around at 120. Now those women will move up to the 100s. Consequently some 82.5s may also start to move up.
powerlifting,God yes. I would love more than one or two other +84s at anything below Nationals. But I would like to see more women in general. Kind of sucks when all women fit into a single session at comps where there are 3+ sessions for men.
powerlifting,Thanks for the input. Tape does sound like a good solution. We could also write DEADLIFT on the tape to fool-proof it even further.
powerlifting,"There is an area called ""Body Of Christ""? that is weird."
powerlifting,"Hey all, when do I taper before a meet? My program has a 3-day training week of taper and I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm supposed to do that the week of the meet or the week before it (assuming the meet is on a weekend). Also am I supposed to not train for a while before the meet?"
powerlifting,"I mean that honestly just sounds like you have a grudge against raw lifters and that's not based just on this reply. Caring about lifting the most weight in a sport where lifting the most weight is the goal doesn't seem that odd to me. Sure, top lifters aren't the healthiest, but that's the case in all sports that are the tiniest bit competitive."
powerlifting,"The most common one I‚Äôve seen in comps is the Rogue one, but I think it‚Äôs worse overall than the Texas dl bar personally. Most people won‚Äôt notice the difference though."
powerlifting,Definitely Third Coast
powerlifting,"Can't go wrong with an ODB, either zinc or stainless to help protect it from rust.

For identification, put different colors of tape on the collars for different kinds of bars. Yellow for DL bars, red for squat, green for all purpose/beater bars, etc. Print out a chart and put it on the walls. Forever banish anyone that misuses a bar for something other than its designed purpose."
powerlifting,"Let's say I work in a gym and we're talking about getting a deadlift bar or two to serve our powerlifters. Exactly what bar should we get? Would it help to get one with a coating so it's easily identifiable from the other bars?

Overall I'm thinking it needs to be whatever bar is most widely used in competition. I know there's Ohio Deadlift bars, Texas, Okie.. I bet at least a few members would want a kabuki bar. I dunno, can y'all help me out here?"
powerlifting,Third coast prolly your best bet
powerlifting,"Powerlifting now days is saturated lifetime intermediate lifters who justify their bad form and proceed to coach others into bad form because the coach received a Bachelor's degree in Exercise Science and did two local USAPL meets. 

Nobody takes the time to learn how to minimize joint pressure, they only care about lifting the most weight today. Then these #alwaysraw bois get knee or back injuries after 5-8 years and turn into bodybuilders or MMA fighters."
powerlifting,My flatmates bf was shocked I was 19 cause he thought I was buff enough to be like 22. I shall take this as a massive W and I shall use it to fuel my aim for a 500kg total
powerlifting,"Appreciate it. I just wasn't sure if I should increase the weight for bench cause it's moving so fast. I know that the goal is to keep the weight lighter to build more volume, but I feel like I have more recovery banked up still"

powerlifting,I don't think there is an ideal height to evaluate all elements of a lift. I think it depends on what you are concerned about.
powerlifting,I just want to thank everyone that is a part of this community. Participating and seeing everyone's work and progress keeps me motivated in a way that I don't think I could manage on my own.

In between attempts: sour patch kids, rice Krispy treats (fast digesting carbs)

In between events: slow digesting carbs (brown or basmati rice) and some protein. Limit fats or take VERY low amount unless you'd like to spray the spotters with poop. Especially if you take caffeine."

powerlifting,put laptop in rucksack with school supplies. put gym stuff in gym bag. solved. go to gym with your things. put it close to you. solved.
powerlifting,"Your shoulders look like they are a little too forward, think about drawing them back a little and the bar looks a little too low on you, aim for the shelf on top of your delts"
powerlifting,"Judging from the 3/4 view, i don't think you are wedged in enough.  
Your arms look relatively slack, and i'm sure that translates into the upper back tension as well.  
You have to create a lot of tension in the system of your upper back and arms.  
The shelf does take nearly all the weight of the bar, but you also will have a lot of tension between the bar and the arms.  
It is not a comfortable thing.  


CWS vid on the setup  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEy5WFr-CDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEy5WFr-CDA)  
And this is my take. ""Jammed in""  
https://streamable.com/kpcrzi  
I do have a very narrow grip, but i worked it in over the years, a finger width at a time only every few months.

You want your grip to be as narrow as your shoulder mobility allows (like CWS mentions)   
It's not comfortable, but it shouldn't be painful.  
Rushing moving your grip in can lead to joint issues."
powerlifting,"I've literally never lifted in a singlet aside from meet day, and there is something I enjoy about putting on the singlet being part of a special ritual for day when it's really time to flip the switch.  But objectively this is probably the way to go if you feel comfortable rocking one in your normal training environment.  I simply don't see much of a downside to using the singlet, and this is a valid upside (you probably will be fine if you've been monitoring your standards carefully even in your normal outfits, but it never hurts to check since you can see all these things more clearly in a singlet)."
powerlifting,"I too have found that less is more on volume for my own deadlift.  For what it's worth, although I don't do conjugate, your formula seems similar to what I've been progressing well with for a couple years.  I hope this continues to serve you well."
powerlifting,"guys what do i do

&amp;#x200B;

1. Put my laptop in my gym bag, which is a shoulder duffel bag with a lot of room
2. Put my gym stuff in my uni bag, a rucksack, which makes it very full

&amp;#x200B;

i cant decide whats worse, i wanna go to the gym after my uni lectures to cut down on time"
powerlifting,"Uncrustables, green apple gatorade"
powerlifting,"Imo, camera between hip and knee heigjht when standing is best for recording for evaluating depth.  
I use that same height for bench, though it's not quite as critical.  
It works out fine for bench for me too, and i just use the same setup as for squat.  
In my case two books on top of a low bookshelf with the camera on them.  
Touchpoint and barpath easily observed.  
If you are using safeties on squats, have them high enough so they are just below the lowest point the bar reaches.  
Besides just being most effective having them there for setting the bar down (forward) if you get stapled, it also makes it so they don't block the camera from seeing your hips crease, leg/knee  
That camera placement also keeps the plates from blocking the view.

powerlifting,"I think you should def bring it up. As long as you‚Äôre not a dick about it, it‚Äôs part of being a coach the same way they give their clients feedback. And if they take it the wrong way I think that tells you a lot about them and whether you want them to continue being your coach."
powerlifting,"I would love to see more great quality posts being made outside of the daily threads... but I‚Äôm also aware that I have made zero such posts and put zero such effort into doing so. 

The only complaint I have with the current system is just that the reddit search function is absolute garbage. Unfortunately reddit admins seem to be okay with that - since it‚Äôs been horrible for at least the 10 years I‚Äôve been on reddit üòÖ"
powerlifting,can yall reccomend any cheap tripods? also how high does a tripod have to go for it to be good to record my lifts with? sometimes the phone on the floor with a water bottle makes it hard to see depth etc
powerlifting,"Like what though? Every thread that gets deleted is ""What are lifting belt?"" or ""I know everyone says it's fun to do a meet and there's no reason not to but should I do a meet?"" 

This comes up every now and then and the answer every time is ""If someone posts something quality the mods will leave it up."" Given the near-zero number of posts apart from the usual, you can guess how much quality stuff gets posted."
powerlifting,Rice crispie treats
powerlifting,"Yeah I think from my perspective, it might come off as confrontational and then the relationship may sour (which is what I want to avoid). 

But you‚Äôre right, I think I‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs much change in the coming weeks and if not I‚Äôll be upfront about it."
powerlifting,"I kind of agree. I understand why it is how it is, but also believe that some discussions are better if they get their own threads."
powerlifting,In a meet? Sour sweets all the way
powerlifting,Lmao
powerlifting,"You may want to change how you hold the bar. Do you see how bent your wrists are in that side view? You don't want that. You want to rotate your hands a bit (think knuckles more on top of the bar) so that your wrists are in a neutral position. 

Someone also explained it to me that you want to feel like you are ""wrapping"" the bar around your back when you are holding it. 

You do have to actively hold the bar a bit more low bar squatting and it can take some time to get used to."
powerlifting,"3 more weeks of off-season volume, followed by a 1 week deload, a little 3rm max testing, then a 13 week block in preparation for a March 4th meet. Excited that I‚Äôm getting close to on-season programming again after almost 4 months"
powerlifting,SSB is great on it's own but also for good mornings and on hooks at the bottom of the rack to prop your rear foot on Bulgarian split squats.
powerlifting,"A lot of people are scared to be upfront with their coaches.

You're paying for a service and if you're not receiving it you have to let them know.

Best case scenario they respond well and improve. Worst case they don't care or don't do anything differently.

I've had meh experiences in the past myself. It's critical to get it right. It's not personal, you can still respect them but I'd they're doing a poor job then it's a poor job."
powerlifting,Go to meet snacks/hydration to keep you going throughout your lifts? I find myself feeling gassed by the time I get to my deadlifts attempts
powerlifting,"Hey all, I‚Äôve recently been feeling pretty unstable under squats in a low bar position and am seeking advice. My issue is that I don‚Äôt feel like the bar is stable on my back even though I‚Äôm creating the shelf (atleast I think I am).

I have a few videos here:
[3/4 View Squats](https://streamable.com/3mcvxm)
-
[Back view squats](https://streamable.com/ggfbfd)

What I‚Äôm feeling in the squat is that it‚Äôs not actually resting on my back and I‚Äôm more so constantly trying to hold it as tight as possible otherwise it‚Äôs going to fall off. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs too low or what, but just seeking any advice out there."
powerlifting,Can we allow a wider variety of content on the main? This sub is boring and quality information is buried in the daily threads. Just my 2c.
powerlifting,Meet went really well yesterday. Totalled 720kg with a lot in the tank. Finally got 400+ on bench !!!
powerlifting,"He's really damn good at being a coach, he's just got a main job so kinda just did it at base value and doesn't upcharge"
powerlifting,"Was able to upgrade my home gym with some killer Craigslist finds. SSB, some bands, log.

But I‚Äôve only ever run really basic powerlifting programs. Looking for something that incorporates this new stuff (maybe not the log). I suppose I can just add them as accessories but interested to see what is out there"
powerlifting,"I've been making my own conjugate workouts for a few months and I equalled my lifetime DL PR today on ME day, but for some reason the video didn't work.... so I pulled it again.  Got a crappy video of it.  Floor is usually my sticking point but today the sticking point felt much more brief than it ever has before.  and judging from the video it didn't slow down at all.

This is the first time I've gone heavy on conventional deadlifts since starting conjugate at the beginning of July.

I have been doing snatch grip DL for speed work as a constant for a few weeks, with the ME lifts varying constantly.  A lot of good mornings for rep work.  I'm not sure what the game changer has been but I haven't lifted this weight since 2 years ago and that was in a peaked state. This is just a monday so I'm pretty happy with it.  It could also just be doing way less volume that is helping."
powerlifting,"Ask to work in! Evern if they say no, it puts the heat on knowing someone is waiting (and watching?). Decreases the chance they will just sit on their phone for 4 minutes between sets."
powerlifting,"Day 6 of sheiko bench emphasis is done. Definitely feel like I'm adapting to the volume now, and my bench is flying. Squat and deadlift intensity feels good.

When is a good opportunity to test my maxes mid cycle? Or do I just hunker down and wait till the end?"
powerlifting,Good point!
powerlifting,"Definitely wasn‚Äôt an RPE 10 going over the [video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cj_-nwkM8MP/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=), but the PR attempt was impromptu and it‚Äôs 20lbs over my last PR so I figured I‚Äôd play it safe, especially considering I injured my pec in July."
powerlifting,You should probably do all your competition singles in a singlet at least once so there are no surprises on meet day. You don't want to go to the meet and find out the singlet reveals either depth issues or a rising butt that the gym clothes were hiding.
powerlifting,$30 a month is insane if this coach is providing even adequate service. Either it's a side gig for fun supplementing their day job or they're living in a cardboard box.
powerlifting,"This is why I start wearing my singlet everywhere about a month before a meet. Gym, grocery store, office, around the neighborhood, in the shower. You really have to break it in if you want consistent performance both in training and on meet day"
powerlifting,Thanks!!!
powerlifting,That‚Äôs very very much on the low side from what I‚Äôve seen.
powerlifting,"Not necessary, but may give you confidence by eliminating any point of inexperience prior to the meet."
powerlifting,"It's not necessary, but you might feel more confident if you've worn it in public at least once."
powerlifting,"Hey, all! I have my first meet in less than 2 weeks and I was wondering if it is necessary for me to train in my singlet at least once before it. I see other people doing it and was curious about it."
powerlifting,"I was (and currently am) running Swede Burns' 5thset. It includes SSB box squats as a secondary squat movement.

powerlifting,Every accessory machine I need is busy in going to start biting the weights soon
powerlifting,"My wife isn't pleased with how much size I've put on and like you I'm not some mass monster but I went from a 148lb runner to 195ish. I love making fun of her barometer of I can't fit my hands around your biceps, which I don't really hit outside of like 6-8 accessory sets a week. The last time I saw my mom for my brother's wedding she just said oh you have muscle now."
powerlifting,"Mine didn‚Äôt want me to lift because I‚Äôd get ‚Äútoo big‚Äù

40lbs of lean mass later, its no longer a concern of hers ha"
powerlifting,"Yeah I went through the ""token asian"" phase at my gym to just being the guy who deadlifts alot."
powerlifting,I use them as an accessory after dead‚Äôs for middle back/lats (just different arm angle) and love them.
powerlifting,Those two things are synonymous my friend
powerlifting,"Signing up for your first meet is definitely exciting! But I get being nervous, too. If I could go back in time and give myself advice before my first meet, I would probably focus a bit on attempt selection. 

For first attempts, decide on weights that you can could lift any day of the week. There should be no doubt in your mind that you can get them.  Because as long as your first attempts are good and you get a score on the board, you're in the game. Selecting those weights ahead of time -- and assuring yourself that you will be able to hit them no matter what -- should go a long way towards assuaging pre-meet anxiety."
powerlifting,The 45 degree cue might be bad but you want to tuck a bit to avoid shoulder impingement.
powerlifting,"Just signed up for my first meet, pretty happy with my current lifts at 93kg (S-425lbs, B-315lbs, D-475lbs). Currently got a mix of being nervous and also excited. curious if anyone has some first time tips they'd like to share? also curious about how important having a coach is?"
powerlifting,You should just talk to him.
powerlifting,"Tfw you start going to a pl gym so instead of being ""the powerlifter"" you become ""the guy who destroys the bathroom"""
powerlifting,"Yup, middle-weight USPA/USAPL lifter here, and agreed - 4x per week is pretty common - I just only happen to make it to the gym 3x per week.  I could bench in the basement, but I'll wait until my current program starts failing me, and then add some lunch bench on one of my off days."
powerlifting,I think your transverse abdominus has to do a big iso hold in both reverse hyper and good morning (when someone says rev hyper hurts their stomach I know they have weak abs or they aren't using them right). With hypers since you can load a good deal of weight and do a lot of reps at a time it is good for challenging the isometric strength of the abs without risking failing heavy squats and deads. Isometric ab strength has the greatest carryover to sbd of any sort of core workout
powerlifting,"So I am a pretty decent powerlifter - I competed this last weekend and had the same total as Layne Norton from 2 weeks ago (he was at IPF masters worlds), in the same weight class, and we're 1 year apart - him being older - I could theoretically compete with him at Worlds next year when I move into masters - he took first place.

For reference, I totaled 1636.9 at 219, with a 600lb squat, 363 bench, and a 672 deadlift (I also took a 4th deadlift for a state record in submasters and successfully pulled 683 - had I taken this for my 3rd attempt I would have beaten Layne's total, but he would still have had me with DOTs).  

I use the Barbell Medicine Powerlifting II template, except I modify it for myself.  They have you benching 4 days a week, but I only make it to the gym 3 times a week so I cut out 1 variation per lift to get the program to 3 lifts per day, 3 days per week.  This is the most I've ever benched volume wise, and it showed.  My bench has always been a weak spot - my previous competition best was in 2018 and I had hit 352. I took a bunch of time off from 2019 until about a year ago.  I ran the PL II twice, with a powerbuilding block before that.  When I started the powerbuilding block I was barely benching 300.  My all time PR for touch and go was 355 (2018), and now I have hit 375 with room in the tank while coming into peaking.  I did this while improving my other lifts as well - previous bests of 585 (squat) and 661 (dead).  I also had another 5-10kg in the tank in both the bench and squat on the platform - so this template worked really well for me.

The template I modified is a paid version, something like $50 USD.  They also have a free program called The Bridge which is aimed at intermediates.  It also only benches twice per week, but also has a OHP day which is a decent accessory for bench (one I should probably do more of).  I would personally cut out OHP in the second meso cycle (weeks 5-8) in this program, and move to something like close grip, or overload (slingshot, etc).  Really though, their pay programs are phenomenal and worth the money IMO - especially if you catch it during a sale.

My other advice though would be to not do much ""experimenting"", or program jumping.  I know I made the suggestion, but if you made decent progress on the current program you could always just run it again until it stops working - that's typically the time to reassess anyway, and one thing to do is increase frequency.  But IMHO bench should be high frequency until you break into those big numbers (200kg or so), I should probably even do 4 days a week myself, but this is working so I'll stick with it. So IMO it might be a good time to program hop to something that has a bit more bench volume/frequency and then stick with that program for a bit.  Hope it helps!"
powerlifting,"Coaching is a skill that takes a long time to develop. Someone can be a great lifter and great person and still not be a great coach. This is a pretty big problem in powerlifting, to be honest...someone hits big totals or starts winning big comps and all of a sudden they're selling coaching services based entirely on their reputation with little actual coaching training or experience.

Ultimately you're paying for something you aren't receiving. I think it's better to be upfront about the situation rather than let it simmer for months. Like, ""Hey, I was hoping to receive x/y/z but I rarely hear anything from you once I get my program for the week. I was hoping there would be more communication."" If it doesn't work, it's nothing personal, just a mismatch between athlete and coach. You won't mesh with every coach and a good coach understands that, too."
powerlifting,"It's a risk calculation in the end. A proper injury might set you back months and take the wind out of your sails in terms of progress rate anyway, but in a pace you can't control. If you pace yourself by conservative load caps until you are able to lift heavy and to standard *fully pain free*, you are at least in control. If you are progressing you are breaking your stall anyway, the pace is secondary. Reality is, if you experience pain in training already, that's the biggest threat to your momentum. I'm against alarmism, but training despite pain is typically only okay under a set of conditions, such as it is (a) not being actively aggreviated by your movements and loads and (b) it is either getting better over time despite training or at the very least not worse. Also, consider that whatever broke yohr plateau wasn't the thing you are doing right now, but breaking your plateau allowed you to do the things you are doing now. In other words, the momentum you are precieving is the result of [whatever you did], not the driver for [more predictable momentum]. 

Don't burn yourself out for instant gratification, put yourself into a position that will favor making progress for a long, long time by staying healthy."
powerlifting,"Minimum should be programming, form checks, and reasonable responsiveness to weekly check-ins or off the cuff questions IMO"
powerlifting,"Yeah that‚Äôs generally what I was expecting, since it demonstrates that the coach is engaged and cares about your progress/goals.

It sucks because I really wanted the situation to work - I really do respect the coach as a person."
powerlifting,"Yeah and I feel like my form‚Äôs quite botched since I‚Äôve really only started focussing on powerlifting recently, so I was really keen on the form critiques"
powerlifting,Thanks for the feedback!! Maybe I should experiment with another program?
powerlifting,"I guess a large part of why I haven‚Äôt brought up my concerns is that I feel like I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúrock the boat‚Äù (stupid I know) - since I genuinely really respect the coach as an athlete. But yeah, it just feels like they may not be too engaged atm."
powerlifting,"It'a common (at least where I am) for coaches to do check-ins, form/cue work, and answer questions on a set schedule like once a week. But radio silence is a pretty big red flag...you can get free programming all over the internet, what you're really paying for is expertise and guidance.

You should bring this up with the coach and see what they have to say, but it sounds like you're just not a great match. You might be happier moving to a new coach."
powerlifting,Whew. My coach is always giving form critique and answers any questions without fail and he's 30 dollars a month
powerlifting,Hmm I haven‚Äôt brought it up as it hasn‚Äôt been too long since I got coaching (a bit over a month) though in the package it did include weekly form analysis + daily communication.
powerlifting,$50 a week
powerlifting,Have you brought up those concerns with your coach? They won‚Äôt be able to correct or clarify if it‚Äôs not brought to their attention. Are there specifics listed in the contract that you don‚Äôt feel are being met?
powerlifting,"&gt;mum called me 'disgusting' because i look like a bodybuilder. I take that as an absolute win

My wife was not very pleased when i started changing from lifting.  
""You don't have a neck anymore""  
I'm not even hyper muscular.  
Certainly not a big neck by powerlifting standards.  
But i was a slim 165lb cyclist when we met."
powerlifting,How much are you paying
powerlifting,"Was going to start my max out week today, but woke up with my stomach churning. So looks like I'll start tomorrow. Hoping for a 420lb squat, a 350lb bench, and a 475lb deadlift."
powerlifting,"Have I set my expectations for a powerlifting coach too high? Feel like initially I was expecting coaching to have a high degree of communication, critiques in terms of forms/cues, and overall feeling supported in terms of reaching my powerlifting goals.

It feels very business-like currently, mainly getting my programs updated week by week (which have been good programs) but not too much on the lifting analysis and support. From my end I feel like I do reach out for questions and whatnot but sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm getting ignored. But yeah am I expecting too much? Maybe our communication styles are too varied."
powerlifting,"I bench 3 days per week as well, and it‚Äôs funny because in my group of powerlifting friends it is considered ‚Äúlow frequency.‚Äù We‚Äôre a bunch of light to middle weight USAPL lifters and a few of the guys are benching 5 days a week.

I agree with what you said regarding people with a sub 200kg bench - Should **probably** be benching at least 3 days a week."
powerlifting,I'm kidding btw. I am also a law student
powerlifting,No those both take up all my time tbh.
powerlifting,"I've always shifted to higher volume training after a meet.  I don't *intend* for it to hide whatever weirdness happens after a meet but it's a nice side effect.

I guess I'm trying to say that there probably isn't really a ""normal"" for this and I wouldn't read anything into it other than that's how you as an individual react to a peak and a meet.  Unless you're trying to do two meets a week or two apart it's not something that affects you in the grand scheme of things."
powerlifting,"Its good you like that tag better. Im sure you are a lot more than just gay and a powerlifter, though."
powerlifting,"Looks as if that program has a scheduled deload every 4 weeks, but technically week 1 is a deload compared with week 12.  You're probably safe to move straight in as long as you aren't incredibly sore.

FWIW first time seeing this program, I don't really like it.  The author is more credentialed than I am, but it looks like one of those programs where it should come with a caveat that you shouldn't always be copying what the best people in the world are doing.  So I throw that in there, because this looks like a relatively low volume program for anyone with a sub ~200kg bench.  I'm having great success benching 3 days per week myself, and none of them particularly light.  This reminds me of the Westside DUP method, which again - just not great for people that don't already have huge numbers."
powerlifting,"Back exercise pretty much.  


I mean, you're basically *always* bracing to some extent, it's how you keep your torso upright while you're walking around.  The higher the bracing demands, the less you're able to breath while bracing.  So if you're doing really heavy rows with a LOT of body-English the bracing demands might be high enough to work your diaphragm.  But usually you're just taking a breath and bracing slightly for each rep.  


If you're doing like 10-rep sets to RPE 6 the bracing demands are probably low enough that you can breath through the reps.  


If you think your bracing needs work I wouldn't count rows as movement that will help with it.  There are plenty of other good reasons to keep doing rows."
powerlifting,Turns out when people refer to me they refer to me as 'the powerlifter' which makes me really happy for some reason. Probably because I used to be known as 'the gay guy' so it's nice to be refered to something I chose to do
powerlifting,The slower cut ( smaller deficit) is the better approach to minimize the impact on your perfomance. Depending you your BF something between 0.25\~0.50% BW per week is a safe range to retain strenght and minimize/avoid  muscle loss.
powerlifting,Congrats!! Did it turn out to be RPE 10?
powerlifting,"Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm doing Gillingham 12 week raw bench program. Next week is the last week. Am I supposed to take a Deload week afterwards or am I good to restart with new 1RM?"
powerlifting,"It‚Äôs my understanding that you‚Äôre able to recruit additional muscle groups more efficiently at that angle as opposed to flared, which is good for upper chest isolation."
powerlifting,"You don‚Äôt need to tuck your elbows 45 degrees or whatever. That‚Äôs a remnant from the WSBB dominated days. 

The idea is that some limited amount of tuck helps you touch lower (generally good) and helps you stay in a better position off the chest. 

You can find very good lifters with all types of techniques (Kodama and Thompson are very flared, for example)."
powerlifting,"I agree completely, and would also like to suggest that there's a bit of a wind up with a fast setup that could be getting them ready for the pull that they don't include in the slower setup.

I have a measured setup and pull the slack out, but once it's out I do one last leg extension (so my hips shoot up) and resettle into the start, then pull. My coach approves of that method, and when I tried to remove it on the theory that I might be messing up my own setup I found my normal weights to be significantly harder."
powerlifting,Finally hit 315lbs on bench last Friday!
powerlifting,mum called me 'disgusting' because i look like a bodybuilder. I take that as an absolute win
powerlifting,"Just finished day 1, works great so far! Been looking for an app like this for a while, that is easier to use than sheets."
powerlifting,Hope you feel better! Goodluck!!!
powerlifting,"Thank you very much, will try your suggestions and see where it goes üí™üèª"
powerlifting,Thanks for the feedback! Yes the smallest plates might be the most US gym friendly. I‚Äôll try to add the new increments. And I‚Äôll take a look at the back button issue ad well. Thanks!
powerlifting,"&gt;Nothing is worth risking overuse injury over

Good point, the thing is i have kind of stalled for a pretty long time, now that i broke that stall i am extreamly eager to keep up the momentum. I will definitely slow down, i don't want to injure myself. Thanks"
powerlifting,Good lift as 250 but I don't think anyone noticed at all
powerlifting,"Passive movement structures always take longer to adapt than active structures. Lower vascularization, fewer ECM secreting cells, you can't surplus your way out of that. I understand you want to get the most from your bulk, but it's probably best to be selective with which sets you go ham on. If you can't increase weight on your comp bench every week without pain, but you have an accessorie like dumbbell incline press or OHP that doesn't bother the tandon, why not put more effort there, etc. Nothing is worth risking overuse injury over."
powerlifting,"Im pretty new to powerlifting and started while bulking  3/4 months ago, added nearly 100kg to my total in 3 months but now I want to cut as I‚Äôve gone from 78kg to now 94kg and although my numbers have shot up so has my body fat, how do I cut effectively to not lose strength but also cut fat like do I cut fast as in 1kg a week or do I take it slow 0.25kg a week just want to know the most efficient way to continue to progress but whilst cutting :) any advice welcome"
powerlifting,"I just downloaded the app and started 531 bbb. Two pieces of feedback:

When choosing kg weighs, the lightest plate numbers are 0.5kg, 1kg. I'm pretty sure most gyms actually don't have 1kg plates, but 1.25kg plates. Atleast that goes for all gyms I've been to in Europe. So I would consider adding 1.25kg and 2.5kg increments, so you don't end up with odd numbers like 86kg, which is unloadable. Not a huge deal ofc.

Second, when using the normal ""back"" function on Samsung instead of the top left function inside the app, the app will most often just close fully instead of going back."
powerlifting,"It's not really bad.

powerlifting,"okie okie gotya. 

I played table tennis and tennis in hs. So when I transitioned to powerlifting, esp for bench, I've had bad tricep tendonitis , pec issues. SHoulder issues. You name it. i've even did bench everyday. the program was 7 days a week as well. Now I train 6 days a week. 3x a week bench. No aches. no pain. just a lil soreness here and there. no more tendonitis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I suggest (i'm not a physio):

1. do less. you're doing too much too soon.
2. as you said, warm up sets make it feel better. i want you to start your sessions with bands. banded pull apart. banded tricep pulldown. hammer accessory. hammer curls. reverse curls. 
3. if pain is to much, try substituting exercises. for pulling, try straps and or suicide grip. 

aches/pain/soreness is one key variable to take note on for going on a deload. 

imma suggest a week of 50% volume and intensity with the bands pre and post workout. see how you feel after."
powerlifting,"Stronger position for force production + easier on shoulders. When NFL players tackle, they tuck elbows as well"
powerlifting,Why do I need to keep my elbows tucked in about 45 degrees when I bench? Why is flaring bad?
powerlifting,"During everyday movements I sometimes feel a bit of pain which lasts only for a couple seconds and then it's all good. 

During the first sets for some muscle groups (see below) i usually feel pain in the tendons, after i warm up the pain tends to fade away but it is still there to some degree. 

My [tricep tendon](https://barbellrehab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distal-triceps-tendon-min-300x169.jpg) is the freaking worst, i need 4 or sometimes even 5 warmup sets before being able to lift somewhat pain-free.

For heavy pulling lifts i feel pain in [this area](https://www.merckmanuals.com/-/media/manual/home/images/p/h/y/phy_elbow_hurts_sports.gif?thn=0&amp;sc_lang=en) (only the above picture)

During chest exercises i feel my pecs and shoulders are getting tighter when i stretch the mucles at the bottom part of the movement.

Trap focused pulls are making my traps slightly sore and tender

I wouldn't say i need a deload week, i am consistently deloading ever 4/5 weeks and these problems are coming as early as week 2"
powerlifting,how do you feel your tendons? pain? sore? perhaps it's time for a deload my guy. take a week of reduced volume. see how you feel after.
powerlifting,"I have been bulking for the past 2 months and the strength gains have been absolutely crazy (I am a 1 and a half year lifter) however my tendons are getting sorer and sorer.

Do you have any suggestions for tendon health and strength during a strength spike such as what i am currently experiencing?"
powerlifting,"No, even the days you're working out. Just every day. Brands don't matter much, get the cheapest creatine monohydrate."
powerlifting,Your squat may just take a harder hit after max effort work and needs more time to build back.
powerlifting,"I took it easy the week after and mostly did light stuff and cardio. Also, I am not talking about my peaking strength. I used to be able to do sets of at least 4-5 with 95-100kg before peaking."
powerlifting,"Did you pivot/deload after the meet?

You‚Äôre also no longer peaked. You will likely be weaker until you are peaked again."
powerlifting,Yes. Don't know if it helps my lifts at all but it feels good and I think it's helped me recover faster whenever I strain/hurt my lower back.
powerlifting,Surprised to see reverse hyper and gm works your abs but my abs do get fried after block pulls so makes sense.
powerlifting,The weight lifted.
powerlifting,"For me it's around 2-3kg increase in bw, but I also weigh above 100kg so not that much % wise."
powerlifting,"Don't think I've been able to do even a light leg extension on my left leg without pain for like a decade now.

Meh, better movements out there."
powerlifting,I should know the answer - what counts as his lift then? The misloaded weight?
powerlifting,"For how long is it normal to feel weak after competition? I had mine on the 1st of october and my squat is still not recovered yet.  I went from sets of 4 with 105 kg to sets of 4 to 85 kg after competition. Currently I managed to get up to 95 kg, but I'm still not feeling as strong as before. Deadlift and bench didn't go down much and I'm already making small progress in bench."
powerlifting,"Couple reasons:

1) Ego. Simple as it seems, they're wanting to hit PRs and willing to cut it high thinking it'll be fine. To be clear, there's a fair few who do this and are still very strong, good competitors, BUT will consistently ""underperform"" vs what their training suggests.

2) Comfort/injury risk. For some they'll find it difficult to hit good depth consistently. Ray Williams being one that comes to mind, but plenty of others. Parallel or so might be ""good enough"" for them, and they know they'll have to hit it a bit deeper in comp + be a bit weaker than training suggests given higher."
powerlifting,"By weakest do you mean absolute aka lowest total? If so, yes, because best lifter is usually some bodyweight coefficient so if you're small enough it's possible, but probably unlikely."
powerlifting,"Yeah I did something similar except I started with a proper starting position. For the grip it and rip it reps I still have the same starting position I just get into it differently. I only discovered I like it after I tried the regular no bounce, slack pull, slow quad activation sumo which was super inconsistent in terms of how much weight I could lift even though the position itself stayed the same. However I used bands instead of pauses."
powerlifting,"I don't know the answer, but I did them for years and never really understood. Took them out (saving energy for actual deadlifts) and saw more progress."
powerlifting,"Just a guess but if you feel stronger ripping &amp; gripping it, your starting position is probably off. I used to rip &amp; grip too but my coach made me do solid reps (pull the slack, no bouncing off the floor), and incorporate a ton of paused work. It sucked at first but I believe paused work helped me the most in finding the strongest starting position."
powerlifting,Thank you!
powerlifting,Honestly a little similar. I dmd you a link
powerlifting,"If you're comfortable, I would include a video or link! Different people may have a different idea of what they consider a ""grip and rip"" deadlift or a bro deadlift. But right now I'm basically picturing something like ssjbobb's deadlift lol"
powerlifting,Is there a problem with gripping it and ripping it on narrow stance sumo deadlift? I have tried the normal slack pull method and found that I am just considerably weaker with it. I switched to a grip and rip method and broke through a plateau and put around 85 lb onto my deadlift in ~10 weeks. I talked to my friend about this and he said that my form is very dude bro ish and that it seems as though I am going to get injured. I don't think I am doing anything wrong with my form as my back is neutral and my core us tight. I also feel absolutely no pain in my back
powerlifting,By daily you mean even days I'm not working out right? Are there any good brands? (3rd party tested)
powerlifting,"Creatine is most effective when taken daily and for extended periods of time, because the point is that you build up/""top off"" the creatine stores in your body so that your body can use it during training. It can cause a slight weight increase but I've yet to see anyone report more than a pound or 2 difference. 

I recommend [this article](https://doclyssfitness.com/creatine-creatine-creatine/), and especially this quote: ""By increasing the storage of creatine we are able to capitalize on the phosphocreatine energy system for longer. Which means more weight or reps or power. Aka delayed fatigue."""
powerlifting,"Many lifters post from angles that make it incredibly hard to judge depth, because they're filming to see other things in their form or they just choose an angle that looks nice for Insta."
powerlifting,"Kind of a side note reply  
I do rows slightly cheaty, but with back angle under 45 degrees, and not much leg action.  
Bar to sternum  
Also from a hang, as in weights don't touch the floor.  
8 reps sets  
I found i needed to take a pretty small breath for my brace ,as the length of time holding the brace was pretty long.  
I never get lightheaded on deadlifts anymore, but doing my rows and also weighted dips i can if i take too much breath in for the brace.  
It's a little scary getting lightheaded with a dip belt on while hanging in mid air."
powerlifting,"Both. You're bracing to maintain your back position. Your back is being used during the row itself.

As to what it's primarily used to train- it's focused on training your back, not for training to brace hard."
powerlifting,"after a few months of program hopping with no progress, finally starting to get back to pb territory. a few more weeks."
powerlifting,Are barbell rows a back exercise or a bracing exercise?
powerlifting,"i had a coach and just did what he said to, and repeated my coach's words of ""don't be shit"", ""do it again, but better"", and ""fuck that was bad"" through my head the whole time.  
Also, I likely had the actual strength there for more than 180 &amp; 200 at the start of prep, just not the technique for getting white lights. I'd always just done BB training prior to these 20w leading up to the meet., and have decent [quads](https://imgur.com/a/wCVBKql)"

powerlifting,Watch Taylor Atwood's how to put on knee sleeves video.
powerlifting,"&gt; Can you be the weakest lifter at a meet and still win best overall lifter?

Best lifter is calculated based on coefficient (DOTS, usually) so if you're the weakest lifter you would by definition be the furthest from winning best overall lifter.

&gt; Can you win anything if you‚Äôre the weakest?

There's a very good chance you'll be the only one in your weight/age/sex/equipment class, so yeah. First place. Also (hopefully) the pride of hitting some PRs and your grandma who watched but wasn't really sure what happened will be proud."
powerlifting,"You mean the lowest total?  If you're alone in your division you'll place first, and if you're sufficiently light you may have the highest point score."
powerlifting,Only if it's Russel Orhii's third attempt.
powerlifting,"Not a great video from which to judge depth; he looks pretty close. But to answer your question in general:

* Other than certain feds which go out of their way to call depth extra strict, from what I've seen most refs will give a little leeway compared to ""by the book"" depth. Bad idea to count on it if you're in a meet, but that's what I've seen. So the people you see squatting high in training are probably squatting high in meets. Either the refs are lenient and all goes well, or you get one of those ""meet didn't go as planned"" posts.
* On sets of multiple reps a lot of lifters worry less about depth than if they're doing a single.
* And yeah, some people are very much in the ""I'll just hit depth on meet day"" camp. Sometimes it works, sometimes not so much."
powerlifting,"The recent phenomenon of wearing ridiculously tight knee sleeves is stupid, put on a pair that you can squat functionally in"
powerlifting,Hard to tell from this angle but he looks like he is at or close to depth from here.
powerlifting,"finally did my first PL comp 2 days ago (I'd mentioned and asked about what to expect back at the 12-16 weeks out mark) and got 240 / 127.5 / 260 SBD for a 627.5kg Total in u90kg, going 8/9 attempts.   
Placed 3rd, though 2nd and 1st were notably higher than myself and even a decent gap between each other.  
Pretty happy with the lifts considering I started prep at 20w out with 180/110/200 SBD (490kg Total)

powerlifting,I‚Äôll give those forums a check! Thanks.

powerlifting,Are you cutting circulation off your feet?
powerlifting,"Unless you are wearing them in competition to try and get and extra pound or two out of them, they shouldn't be so tight that they are affecting the circulation to your feet. Sound like they are too small"
powerlifting,"Why do you think you may need knee sleeves? The strength may not be anything to do with the sleeves. It does happen anyway. 
Try again without and see how it goes."
powerlifting,USAPL is forgiving when it comes to depth

powerlifting,"Why do I see videos of so many really strong dudes who compete squatting higher than comp depth in training? (https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjQa2TqAAGc/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)[For example], but could have chosen an number of videos. Do they just wait till comp to hit depth? Or is my judgement on depth just off"
powerlifting,Thats great. Got that grown man strength to rely on now
powerlifting,"Got back into lifting routinely at 40 after a decade of no activity.  Thought I'd be weak.  I'm by far stronger now than I've ever been after 8 months of regular training.  Hit 440 deadlift, 425 squat and 350 bench (short arm gains) this week."

powerlifting,"Your hips are a bit too high in the video you posted but the largest problem is you don't manage to get your lower back neutral. Hips low isn't optimal, but what I'm suspecting is happening is that when you did that, you managed to get your lower back neutral before starting, and then when you started pulling, your hips probably shot up to roughly the place they should've started, but your back was now in a better position."
powerlifting,"1. Has anyone tried Mag/Ort for squats? 
2. Would you recommend running it simultaneously with Mag/Ort for deadlifts?"
powerlifting,Good work! Post vids
powerlifting,After not being motivated enough last year I set up my home gym and went from 225 in Squat and deadlift to 320 and 375. In 19 weeks.
powerlifting,Good work brotha !
powerlifting,Am I the only one who's sore for a week after squats or deadlifts? Even when i dont work out that hard...
powerlifting,No.
powerlifting,"Before squats and deads I like a little bit of loaded crunch or planks just to feel strong before I load up weight.  I also do stuff like hanging leg raises and ab roller when I feel like it.  Reverse hyper and good mornings feel like my best ab movements thiugh. 
 Feel like most people need a stronger core"
powerlifting,"Since having my coach give me nutrition tips, I‚Äôm down 7lbs! My average this week is 228 on the dot and today I weighed in at 226 something. I‚Äôm super happy as I‚Äôve struggled with my weight all my life but now I‚Äôm losing it and it‚Äôs staying off!"
powerlifting,Does a singlet let you lift any extra weight
powerlifting,"Ahh yes. I do 30 minute ab workouts at home to spot reduce my belly fat. I only go to the gym for the stairmaster, hone and tone baby. I dont touch weights cuz i dont want to get too bulky. After my workouts, i reward myself with pizza for my hard work"
powerlifting,Not that I know of. I try to be pretty careful when doing them because I have a history of knee issues after doing them.
powerlifting,"Not really. Most of the abdominal needs for powerlifting are isometric so if I do feel like I need to incorporate anything I'll usually do planks, though I feel like most of the time just doing the compound exercises is adequate."
powerlifting,I personally used my carry on to wrap my belt around and all my gear I would need to compete in plus a pair of clothes just in case they lost my bag I'd atleast have clothes and what I needed to compete
powerlifting,"This. Everyone has different anatomy which necessitates slight changes from the ""perfect"" positioning. The important things are if you feel strong from that position and you don't feel any pain rather than some ideal hip height."
powerlifting,"For her I‚Äôd probably hit the squat and bench openers on Wednesday too assuming the meet is on the Saturday. Personally, I might even have her do the bench opener or at least last warm-up on the Thursday. I would probably give her a light deadlift single too if time permits mostly for the sake of building confidence."
powerlifting,"doing some snatch grip deadlifts currently, good lord these things just fry your fucking hamstrings. 

i‚Äôm doing them in converse, would you guys recommend doing them in squat shoes like you would do a normal snatch?"
powerlifting,Naw
powerlifting,"I also tried that sorry i didn‚Äôt mention it, I also tried to drop my stomach/dick between my knees lol (rips cue) my lower back kept rounding and also didn‚Äôt feel like I could push the ground away 
I‚Äôve been struggling to do this lift for two years lol"
powerlifting,"&gt; squeezing the chest up 

He later said that this cue led to people not generating enough tension.  
  
That's why on the video that i've sent to you, he says to ""feel heavy on your hands"", basically telling you to pull the slack out of the bar.  
  
But yeah, it could be an anatomy thing, and sometimes it's better to have good advice to someone that's standing right next to you and know their thing than to try to emulate something that you've seen on internet."
powerlifting,"That video might be a bad example but, I can‚Äôt flatten the back out / neutral spine in that position without a little rounding in that set up , I had another video which was better but I‚Äôm definitely following there cues of setting up mid foot ( 1 inch away) bending shins and then squeezing the chest up but then again I have shorter arms longer torso and short femurs I think which i feel In that position all the weights at the front and there‚Äôs no room to push if that makes sense"
powerlifting,"I believe you're speaking about the shins. Are the bar over the middle of your foot? When you bring your knees forward, there is any bar movement? We can only see Step 4 onwards on your form check based on Thrall's video.  
  
They say to not move your hips, because you'll be in what could be considered a optimal position for them.  
  
It could be that these cues just don't work out for you too, because we're all different beings in the end of the day. You could take what the guy that actually seen you and helped you on site as a good advice if everything felt alright.  
  
But following Step 1 to 5, usually works out fine for most people that i've met."
powerlifting,But he says don‚Äôt move the hips at all one knees have touched the bar. Just like mark rippetoe
powerlifting,"That's not a bad idea. Being her first comp I guess some practice warming up to her openers will be handy, so she can get a feel for how she'll do it that weekend. Thanks for the suggestions!"
powerlifting,"That's a reasonable tapering strategy, although it may leave her with more rest than she needs, especially as a small, novice lifter. My default is to test all three openers on Monday, warm up (i.e., do everything up to the openers) on Wednesday, and then rest."
powerlifting,"&gt; So I‚Äôve followed Alan thralls videos keeping the hips high.
  
From the form check video that you've posted, you probably didn't followed it right tho.  
  
In his video, he says that you need to have your armpits just above the barbell, and to flush your knees into your arms so you can sit down in the most optimal position for you.  
  
[Here is the part of the clip where he references that.](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPJbSQ4aZTZYFa-Ou3CpAU1QKC4All5m_)"
powerlifting,He is absolutely undervaluing his time and I pay him extra because of it
powerlifting,"Okay that sounds pretty good. She hasn't maxed out on any lifts in around 4 weeks, not planning to until comp, but her top sets from last 2 weeks are looking promising ( 4x3 at 92.5 on deads was RPE 8 \~ last set, 70x5 on squats was RPE 8.5 \~ and 35 x 6 on bench was RPE 8.5 \~ ). I think running one more 4 week block then the last week as a taper, with a deadlift opener on the monday, squat and bench on the tuesday and then wed-fri off with comp on saturday sounds good? 

Aswell as 90% \~ singles on the heaviest day for SB just to get used to the heavier weights."
powerlifting,"Can any experience powerlifter give me some advice regarding conventional Deadlift 

So I‚Äôve followed Alan thralls videos keeping the hips high. I did some sets felt really weak barely could get 110kg up. 

A guy comes over to me and says sit down more (lower the hips) he tells me to keep my hips fairly low - He explained that you get more leg drive he then showed me his deadlift right there infront of me 250kg (he‚Äôs a powerlifter that competes) 
I was like wow, I then try what he said keep the hips low and chest up immediately 3 reps (120kg) of the weight i was struggling with following Alan thralls high hips. 
I have a video on my reddit profile of following the Alan thrall method my lower back feels a little in pain. But following the other guys method nothing at all in the back so I‚Äôm conflicted due to every saying don‚Äôt deadlift with low hips cus it can lead to squatting the weight but I felt massively stronger."
powerlifting,"Yuuuuuge

Would love to read a recap"
powerlifting,"What she's doing works for her, so I'd normally advise against messing with it too close to a competition. She could reduce her weekly volume by one set and start her heaviest squat and bench session with an easy (89-93 percent) single to give herself more practice with heavy loads and to ensure that those estimated 1RMs aren't too far off."
powerlifting,Do y'all do ab work when training?
powerlifting,"Best way to prep for a meet, 5 weeks out yesterday?  

My friend ( 19f 47kg ) is new to powerlifting and is currently just under 5 weeks out. She doesn't have a coach but I've been helping her out in terms of programs / programming for the last 12 weeks. She's been running greg nuckols 28x free programs and has made some huge strength gains so far ( 95 &gt; 112.5kg \~ deadlift, 60 &gt; 82.5kg\~ squat and 40 &gt; 45kg \~ bench ). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a good idea now to just run a 5 week peaking program until the end? She wanted to do one more block of these current programs ( 3x dead 3x squat 2x bench ) and then have a one week taper to meet day. What would you guys suggest?"
powerlifting,Finally snagged a 1500+ total in comp
powerlifting,High bar volume sets can kick rocks. Definitely enjoying seeing the muscle growth and feeling stronger but damn they feel like cardio :(
powerlifting,"&gt;I am unable to squat deep without weight on my back. I lose my balance whenever i try. How can i fix this?

Try extending your arms out, and leaning your weight forward as you get into position.  
I have my arms against my knees for sit squats for duration.  
Relax into the position, it's not barbell squat form, you aren't hard bracing.  


I like this for mobility.  
just ease into it to the extent your mobility allows, balance with your arms and bodyweight.  
Doing this regularly can improve mobility.  
If the ROM hurts, just use your weight to balance the load on your knees/ankles.  
Then you can relax into it over time.  


But just use your own weight forward to balance.  


This clip was made for someone else, so there is stuff about safety heights at the end.

powerlifting,"Aside from how you're loading the exercise, are you doing anything unusual in terms of knee/leg alignment (e.g. pointing the toes somewhere other than where they naturally point when you sit in the machine, setting it up so that your knees are noticeably behind/in front of the pivot point for the lever you push against)?

The knee can tolerate *some* twisting, but it acts primarily as a hinge joint. Setting up in a way that doesn't allow it to do so might be stressing some tissue in a way that that tissue doesn't really handle well."
powerlifting,Got cleared to squat for the first time since May. Proceeded to do what felt like three sets of nothing and gave myself a crap ton of DOMS.
powerlifting,Recently set a PR on back squat of 120kg from a previous PR of a little over 100kg. I‚Äôm only 60kg and 16M. Still not satisfied though!
powerlifting,Exactly what you are looking for probably doesn‚Äôt exist but some lifters used to post training logs on the Animal forums and elitefts. I don‚Äôt think any top lifters do that today though
powerlifting,"Someone had to say it.

I see KB Swings as a decent exercise to move more and burn some calorie, but they have little to no translation to powerlifting movements.

For posterior chain development any RDL variation, GHR, or even a machine hamstring curl would serve better. For building stability in the start position (and some posterior chain development) Stiff Leg deadlifts are unmatched."
powerlifting,I think I'll decrease the weight by about 25% and increase the rep range from 8-12 to 12-20 and focus more on getting a pump than strength. Hopefully that'll help.
powerlifting,"Didnt lose any DL strength during my short break from hip hinges due lower back stuff. Hit 3x200kg/441lb from 2"" deficit ~6.5RPE on Saturday, best single ive pulled from the floor is 240kg so to me that sounds promissing! Thinkg about pulling ~230kg sub max 2"" deficit single at the end of this meso in few more weeks to see how it go."
powerlifting,"Oh yeah probably. 

On the other hand things don‚Äôt always go according to plan. If it happens every time I would probably be reevaluating the prep strategy"
powerlifting,"I haven't really taken a scientific approach to it (running a program without it for a block, then subbing it in while keeping everything the same), BUT... the training cycles that I have seen the most consistent improvement in deadlift (and squat) have had SSB box squats in them. So there's one more vague anecdote for your consideration!

For me, it feels like they target a lot of my weak points in a single movement that carry over well to deadlift (and squat). In particular: hips, starting power out of the bottom, bracing, and back."
powerlifting,"$100 a month, included weekly programming, unlimited form checks and I can text her as needed for advice or input. I don‚Äôt do weekly check ins because I don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs necessary. If she sees a note on my weekly sheet that she has questions about she will reach out. 

Prior to my first competition we did a video call to discuss my warm ups and openers. That‚Äôs the only time we‚Äôve talked outside of messaging/email

It feels a little hands off but the programming works"
powerlifting,Benched 70kg today. Took me half a year to turn 66kg tng to 70 paused but we did it
powerlifting,https://youtu.be/eNOUctWPJ5I
powerlifting,"Are you trying to take a comp stance wide squat? Because if so, I think that's normal. If you're talking the asian/russian squat, then it's probably your flexibility. Either way I'm not sure /r/powerlifting can help you with this hahah"
powerlifting,I am unable to squat deep without weight on my back. I lose my balance whenever i try. How can i fix this?
powerlifting,"I think I've got a decent amount of gains from them. I've been following the progression linked elsewhere from Andy Bolton and I'm now swinging 10x6 EMOM at 72kg.

I can only compare meet preps for where I am on deadlifts but I haven't got a way to separate whether what's from the swings and what's from just deadlifting.  

Last prep my best sets were 187.5kg x2 and 172.5x4 at 95kg BW or so.  I wasn't doing heavy swings at the time. 

This prep so far I've pulled 190kg x2 with at least one spare and 175kg x6 probably with 1 spare. I weighed in at 90kg on the nose and I've been doing heavy swings for the last 5 months.  

Do them EMOM and they are good GPP if nothing else. I think they might carry over more if I was a sumo puller, as I have to take a wide stance to get my handle through my legs. I also think they've done a really good job of bulletproofing my posterior chain, I've literally had nothing even ache since I started them again."
powerlifting,"$100 a month gets me weekly programming, check ins whenever I want, unlimited spots because it‚Äôs his gym, free in person anything, free handling, free gym gossip."
powerlifting,"Its always good to do a couple of warmup sets for the specific exercise you are doing even if you did something for the same muscle group right before it. Id maybe try doing that, and I usually suggest doing leg extensions one leg at a time, for the added benefit of potentially evening out unnescessary asymmetry. Its also good to keep reps at 12-20+ to limit the load a bit in this exercise."
powerlifting,"Just to the left of my right kneecap. I usually get them programmed pretty shortly after squats so I like to think I'm warmed up enough. It's not a big dead to me if I take them out, but I like having nice quads so I'd just like to replace them with something else."
powerlifting,I agree. She should charge more.
powerlifting,"Shouldnt happen every time, but meets are crowded and the entire thing can be stressful and possibly make you a bit more susceptible to infection."
powerlifting,I often see people describe prepping for a meet being like this. I think if they really feel like this they are doing something wrong.
powerlifting,"Where on/in the knee is this pain? Maybe you are just going too heavy, doing too much overall volume or not warming up adequately?"
powerlifting,"1. You need at least four to be useful.  
2. You need to put them back   
3. It doesn't look as cool on the bar as 2 plates.   
4. It messes up plate math"
powerlifting,"Every time I do leg extensions, I get some slight knee pain for a few days after. Looks like it's time to retire them and begrudgingly add in lunges. Is there anything else I can also add in that isolates quads? I don't have a leg press machine."
powerlifting,Unless your coach is building a cli√´nt base and just starting up hes severely undervalueing his time imo
powerlifting,"$40AUD a week (keeping in mind minimum wage here is $21/hr). 
I get my programming, which can be customised to suit what I want but still meet my goals. A big check in once a week to review a weeks worth of form, comments, questions with very detailed responses and back and forth conversation. Daily responses if I want them on smaller issues here and there (this hurt, can we change it? Quick tip for sticking to bench? Etc). Meet handling and coaching for free if near her base gym, or for an additional fee if I want her to travel. A fun little community of peers all under her coaching. And gossip. Juicy hilarious gossip. And then I can pay a little more if I want in person sessions."
powerlifting,The buildup to and the meet day itself certainly takes its toll on your body. I can see that happening.
powerlifting,"Andy Bolton recommended them as a deadlift accessory, you can read about it [here](https://www.strongfirst.com/kettlebells-and-powerlifting-a-match-made-in-heaven/)"
powerlifting,"Usually 5-6 reps. And I think 8-10 reps works too, but I almost prefer lower for these such that attention to quality is there."
powerlifting,Absolutely. I did a friendly competition like that a year ago and it got me hooked. The atmosphere was awesome.
powerlifting,If equipment was dirty and dusty lol. Got allergic sneezes and rashes. I'm very sensitive to dust
powerlifting,Appreciate your detailed answer. How many reps do you typically do for SLDLs?
powerlifting,No.
powerlifting,Seems like a waste of time
powerlifting,"I coach for 100/month if you‚Äôre a student weekly check-ins, unlimited form checks on main lifts within reason, adjustments as needed. I‚Äôll drop in for sessions as needed or help you if I happen to run into you at the gym. 

Information is free. 

Not plugging myself offering, just trying to help answer your implicit question."
powerlifting,Eh. If your prep and the meet itself made you feel like you were on the brink of collapse the entire time the makes sense. It‚Äôs certainly not abnormal.
powerlifting,Is it normal to get sick after a meet?
powerlifting,"I mean it depends. If you're built to deadlift, you are likely going to progress way faster there than in the other movements. In September of 2021 my best pull was 645 aka 292.5kg, I'm currently at 700 or 317.5kg and that was with me leaving close to 10kg in the tank. Granted I'm also an untested guy and respond really well to singles and doubles, so take it with a grain of salt."
powerlifting,"Yes, if you go to the actual global SBD website and click the retailer link at the bottom you can see which ones are real or not"
powerlifting,"Currently $150/month
Month written ahead of time with adjustments when necessary, response within 24 hours, form advice/cues, macro help"
powerlifting,It happened to me one of the two times I traveled with them - I‚Äôm thinking maybe the jar wasn‚Äôt closed entirely before I packed everything.
powerlifting,"$60/month 
My coach writes my program week to week, response within 24-36 hours to my texts, form advice, occasionally facetimes to help explain cues, also just chats to me about training methodologies and stuff about lifting we find cool."
powerlifting,How much do y‚Äôall pay for coaching and what does your coaching entail?
powerlifting,"Yea they definitely build up my regular deadlift, I just think i need another option to incorporate to keep them moving up in weight"
powerlifting,"I travel with a lever belt all the time. It usually gets flagged in the x-ray, but TSA has always allowed me to carry it on."
powerlifting,"Whoa, I didn‚Äôt know that! I don‚Äôt use them but I‚Äôll warn my team"
powerlifting,"I‚Äôd rather do barbell RDLs than swings personally, better specificity and ability to move bigger weight while keeping your grip strong."
powerlifting,"I kept all my gear including belt in my gym bag, used as a carry on, and checked a bag with everything else. Definitely recommend the drag upgrade if you can swing it, and get an aisle seat. Smelling salts can go bad on the plane - found out the hard way."
powerlifting,"Interesting, I've been doing stiff legged deadlifts for hamstrings/deadlift strength but I think I'm starting to stall on them and dont have access to a leg curl machine."
powerlifting,No rules against wearing it on the plane I think. Or you could fasten the belt around your carry on or personal item
powerlifting,"I don't think it provides enough consistent tension to be a ""builder"" of the hams but it's a great exercise nonetheless because it teaches you how to use the posterior chain and it's great for gpp.  Apparently Alexeev used to swing a 24kg kettlebell for 10 minutes without stopping before every workout"
powerlifting,"Does anyone have any tips for flying for a meet? I‚Äôm planning to keep my gear in my carryon in case of lost luggage, but I‚Äôm worried about getting my belt past the dipshits at the TSA. Also I‚Äôll have to continue my water load through the day of flying. I‚Äôm thinking of upgrading my seat to be sure I get an aisle by the lavatory. Any other thoughts or tips?"
powerlifting,I can't do that in good conscience.
powerlifting,"No, because one, I didn't know whether it was a bug or functioning as intended, and two, when I reported an obvious bug I got back a vague and unhelpful non-answer. I don't recall seeing any documentation stating explicitly that volume would be reduced going forward if you reported a certain difficulty level a certain number of times or if your lifts were going down. And as I wrote, it did change things *within* a session, but not going forward.  

TBH I'm not sure we are talking about the same app. I'm talking about the Android version of JuggernautAI, which may or may not be different from the iOS version, if that's what you have. I sometimes feel as though Android versions of certain apps are redheaded stepchildren."

powerlifting,[https://www.instagram.com/p/Ciz9PvYgmwb/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=](Big plates make you strong)
powerlifting,So did you ever reach out to support or reach out on the fb group to report a problem/bug?I‚Äôve been able to lower my volume from block to block and even within the session.
powerlifting,I have a state record bench press in Minnesota which is pretty cool
powerlifting,Anyone here had any success using Kb swings for hamstring development and deadlift strength?
powerlifting,"I filled out the pre-workout questionnaire every time, and honestly rated the workout after. It definitely did not lower the overall volume going forward."
powerlifting,"Not only does it reduce the volume but it will also reduce the load on the bar if you fill out the pre-workout questionnaire. Not only that, if you keep telling it that you‚Äôre doing too much, it will lower the overall amount of volume you do going forward. 

Are we talking about the same app?"
powerlifting,"I honestly don't understand what the input and feedback were supposed to do. It never really adjusted anything other than during a session if I failed a lift/set I should've made. It would just adjust that exercise for that workout. A couple of months in when I had a lot of accumulated fatigue I kept telling it I was exhausted and everything was hard but it didn't change anything. If I'm telling it I'm wiped out workout after workout and all my lifts are going down and I'm still having to manually adjust my weights and volume then I don't see the point of the ""AI."""
powerlifting,buy them.
powerlifting,Currently suffering from sucess rn (I am currently shitting liquid lava after eating a giant high protein chilli)
powerlifting,"You ^^^^^don't need them, you ^^^^^don't need them"
powerlifting,Talk me out of buying a pair of hundred pound plates.
powerlifting,"I did the sheiko plan that was released years ago for almost two years. Loved the plan, even though the volume took some getting used to. How's gold different?"
powerlifting,"&gt; long femor is disadvantageous to deadlift in general

A lot of the best stiff bar pullers have long femurs. It might be a positive correlation between long lower and upper limb but also long legs is almost synonymous with short torso - shorter hinge moment arm and maybe more room for glute and hamstring hypertrophy on the other side (broscience but l think it makes sense)"
powerlifting,"Have been using Juggernaut AI since March, started with powerbuilding and am now on a powerlifting prep for my first meet in 2 weeks. I saw some really good progress on powerbuilding, my work capacity and base strength were definitely the best it‚Äôs ever been. The volume in hypertrophy blocks was a bit psychotic at times (8RM deficit deadlifts with 5x8 backoffs, etc.) but I responded relatively well to it.

With the switch to PL programming and ramping up to compete, the translation of those rep maxes to max output singles just hasn‚Äôt been there for me. I did have to miss a few weeks in the summer for a non-lifting injury and have lost about 5 pounds while on the program, but I just felt a lot stronger when powerbuilding. I will switch back to it for 2 months or so after competing and use it as an off-season program, but I won‚Äôt run another meet prep with Jugg."
powerlifting,"Do them in a conventional stance. We‚Äôre using stiff legs to train our hinge and get stronger in the ‚Äúoff the floor‚Äù position. 

Stand like you would for conventional, allow your knees to bend a little bit such that you can establish a neutral back position off the floor, and have patience with it off the floor, maintaining that neutral back position.

I am a very technical, max width sumo puller and stiff leg deads are carrying my progress on my comp deads at this point."
powerlifting,Ran jai right after it came out and I‚Äôm amazed there‚Äôs anybody still using it
powerlifting,"No, my flair is old news. I think that flair was from my last meet a couple of years ago"
powerlifting,"It‚Äôs more common than you would imagine, especially as you move into the heavier weight classes. Also just people with short arms/femurs. Those are your bench and squat specialists."
powerlifting,Sheiko Gold developer here. PM me and I'll gift you a 6-month subscription. Just put your knowledge and experience to use and send me regular feedback on how things could be improved. Deal?
powerlifting,"Ran juggai PL and PB. The app and ai parts are second to none and even more adaptable than some other spreadsheet ‚Äòai‚Äô types I‚Äôve seen. However, the underlying programming just wasn‚Äôt it for me. I found it to be a bit too boring and not as easily tweaked for things I know do and don‚Äôt work for me (such as not squatting and deadlifting b2b same day). I hit some rep prs, but the taper and 1RM realization just wasn‚Äôt really there. I also felt like it didn‚Äôt fully adapt to what did and didn‚Äôt work for individual lifts, but rather shoved me into a bit of a ‚Äòwhat works for everyone‚Äô box. It‚Äôs also a gift and a curse that you can choose all your accessories. While I loved the week to week and day of adjustments, I didn‚Äôt love not really being able to look forward or backward very far or very in depth."
powerlifting,+1 more for juggernaut. Once i took my nutrition and training seriously and settled into how to tell what rpe my set was my 3 lifts exploded.
powerlifting,"&gt;	You just need to give it the proper input and feedback.

This times a million. A lot of the people that hate it are the ones that straight up aren‚Äôt honest with themselves on how training feels, or they think they can handle more (or less) than they truly can.

Or they think the app will do everything for them and read their minds. People download it and think they don‚Äôt have to take any ownership of their training."
powerlifting,"I did not. I didn't have a slingshot at the time. One thing I also did was to work on OHP. Light of course to work the upper body in different ranges of motion. In my mind I don't want to just stick with a bench press because then I won't be working the area in different ways to keep it healthy. 

One thing I did to was tempo work to grease the groove and increase confidence on working the full ROM too. This was as I was progressing."
powerlifting,What
powerlifting,I like this approach.  I was actually thinking that some sort of weekly progression would be better for me.  By any chance did you also use a slingshot in your recovery?
powerlifting,I've been using JuggernautAI since the inception back when it was spreadsheets. It has come along way and gotten much more streamlined and user friendly. I've put 350+ lbs on my total using it over the course of 4 years or so. The personalized excercise selection aspect of it is great. You just need to give it the proper input and feedback.
powerlifting,"I ran an ~8 month program on JAI and am about a month I to Sheiko gold atm.

There are definitely pros and cons to each and I recommend taking advantage of their trials. I personally like Sheiko‚Äôs programming more (though the sessions are generally more exhausting). That alone is enough for me to chose it over JAI. It‚Äôs also cheaper, and a hell of a lot cheaper if you buy a year or lifetime sub.

That being said, JAI has a far better UI, and is also a lot more structured. It‚Äôs easier to tell where you are in the program, adjust lifts, training days, etc. Sheiko‚Äôs UI can be super frustrating sometimes, if you input a set incorrectly you can‚Äôt really fix how it adjusts your next sets. It‚Äôs also just sort of a clunky UI, and the program is less structured on a week to week basis. Just my observations so far"
powerlifting,FWIW Sheiko himself disavowed the app a year go: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CVynM5AsPhy/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVynM5AsPhy/?hl=en)
powerlifting,"The video on technique I will always refer people to is Chris Duffins video with Mark Bell. His cues have helped me immensely. 

You need to wedge your hips in, but keep them as high as possible. I know it may sound confusing but I think Mark Rippitoe can over simplify things to where they're a bit... well confusing. I believe what he wanted to stop from happening is how people ""squat their deadlift"""
powerlifting,"I had two strains, one on each side. I used the Starr Rehab Protocol. Instead of doing things exactly like how it's said, I'd progress on a week to week basis and not a daily type of deal. For example I started with 2board and did 3√ó25√óbar for the first week, then added 10s on each side up until I got to 185. Then I took the two board off and worked full rom and went on from there. Took a minute but it worked pretty well. I didn't use ice though. I'm against the use of ice for rehab."
powerlifting,"No worries, glad to help!"
powerlifting,We exist and are totally not at all bitter about getting knocked down 8 spots in the standings after deadlift openers
powerlifting,"For Juggernaut, I loved the ‚Äúdo an RPE10 set of ten, then take 5lbs off the bar and do infinity back off sets.‚Äù"
powerlifting,This is exactly what happened and is a very different approach than what I'm doing.  This is a good read.  Thanks for the link!
powerlifting,"I ran Sheiko Gold for a few months, loved it and then smashed my foot and stopped my subscription since I couldn't put pressure on it. Once I healed up I bought a lifetime membership and more recently the velocity tracker that pairs up with it. I was a big fan of Sheiko programming and ran AML a good bit before Gold was around so I knew I'd respond well to the app.


I ran JuggernautAI back when it was a spreadsheet emailed back and forth and I ended up getting hurt, I think they've changed it around because that was fairly common. I just never want to do another RPE10 set of 10 and I believe that is still a thing."
powerlifting,"I've really enjoyed sheiko gold. I haven't done a meet since starting it about a year ago but I did a mock meet at the start of the summer and hit 540, 310, and 635 at 195lbs bodyweight. The app generates workouts only up to 8 hours in advance based on the previous work and that days fatigue levels. The developer is really active on the Facebook group, always answering questions and improving the app. You can do traditional sheiko blocks but also off-season hypertrophy blocks. I find it easy to use and enjoy the training style. The main reason I chose it over juggernaut ai was the lifetime membership option. I maybe once up front and now can use it forever as much as I want. A lifetime of sheiko gold is cheaper than a year of juggernaut ai so it felt like an easy choice. Plus I've heard people complain about the juggernaut ai giving way too many really hard sets. There's a free trial for sheiko gold, plus you can log as many freestyle workouts (non-ai generated) as you want for free so I recommend giving it a try at least."
powerlifting,I have been running Sheiko Gold for over a year and love it. With the velocity tracker it‚Äôs even better. Do you have any specific questions?
powerlifting,"Wasn‚Äôt a fan a juggernautAI personally. The programming seemed kinda random for me - probably not the case but I guess I had trouble seeing ‚Äúthe forest through the trees‚Äù with that program. 

My recommendation is to go to blackironbeast.com and select 5/3/1‚Äôs ‚Äúsimplest strength‚Äù template and utilizing first set last on your main and secondary lifts. You can use the ap to program your sets but you can use different t secondary lifts if you want, mine looks like this:

Day 1. 

Primary lift: squats

Secondary lift: giant cambered bar squats


Day 2

Primary lift: bench press 

Secondary lift: axle bar OHP 


Day 3.

Primary lift: deadlifts

Secondary lift: SSB squats


Day 4: 

Primary lift: OHP

Secondary lift: Bench with chains



So same scheme as wendlers program but obviously more emphasis on bench and squats."
powerlifting,"I never actually ran Sheiko gold but I did download it and at the time at least you couldn't preview future workouts like you can on Juggernaut AI. Which obviously speaks nothing to the program itself but it does make for a nicer app. 

I have enjoyed using Juggernaut AI but for me it's improved my squat and deadlift more than my bench. It does include fairly regular pressing though so it's probably just me."
powerlifting,[https://sbdthailand.com](https://sbdthailand.com) is this website legit?
powerlifting,Try training cycle with pretty easy squat/dl training and more focus on bench. I got my best bench progress when injured my back.
powerlifting,"Cant comment on the ai, but do have input on the red sheiko app.

There's a ""bench emphasis"" program on there that costs $10 and is a 4day/week program that trains all three lifts but focuses on bench. I've been enjoying the program so far and feel a lot more confident while benching.

If you're looking for an alternate option its worth checking out. I believe this program isn't on a spreadsheet anywhere, but almost every other program from the red app is online if you look around. These ""3 lift 1 emphasized"" programs are unique to that app."
powerlifting,That 2 Timothy 2:5 quote shows someone who is tryna be Carti so bad.
powerlifting,"I don't have any experience with the injury you're talking about myself, but the guy that wrote [this article](https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/rehab-muscle-strains-tears/) seems to have gone through the exact injury you experienced."
powerlifting,"Take the collars off if they‚Äôre on and drape them across the barbell so that the middle of the train is roughly bisected by the bar. You can use clips too but they aren‚Äôt necessary.

For sumo put them all over the center and for conventional half on each side about midway between your hands and the plates. For most people this is right on the bench ring."
powerlifting,"A few months back I tore my pec while prepping for me a meet and since this was my first injury I've been a little hesitant to start benching again. My tear was in the muscle belly with no damage to the tendon so I did not have surgery.  I've been doing   some 2 board press for 3x5 and increasing the weight 5-10 lbs each week and pairing it with some db incline for higher reps. 

 For those of you that have come back from a pec tear, how did you progress your bench?  Not seeking medical advice but would just like to learn from others' experience."
powerlifting,"I don't have experience personally, but my dad donates plasma pretty regularly, and he feels fatigued for a day after. I can't imagine it wouldn't negatively impact training."
powerlifting,Put them between your hands instead.
powerlifting,"When pulling with chains, how do you prevent them from falling off the ends of the bar while also keeping them from falling under the plates?"
powerlifting,I feel like that would heavily contribute to all of these findings
powerlifting,Ed Coan is Ed Coan. True anomaly.
powerlifting,"Anyone help with form of a deadlift
I have a full description of what it feels like from my end on the video. But tldr I don‚Äôt know what else to do I‚Äôve followed Alan thralls tips but still feel weak on this lift 
 https://www.reddit.com/user/Carlondion99/comments/yahjzs/deadlift_form_help/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"
powerlifting,"I squat more. I'm also not big as I weight 60kg.  I got injured in May and for a few months I struggled to make deadlift progress, because of the injury and quad tightness. My squat got my deadlift up a bit, but not to the point where they match. I never deadlifted a lot more than I squatted though, they were always quite close for me. But ever since I have to avoid reaching failure on deadlift as my right hip will hurt, I probably need to get that checked. (Actually, squat can trigger it too, I think, but I am better judge of RPE with squat)"
powerlifting,"You have room to bulk, assuming you wanna compete in the 93kg class. I don't see why you couldn't, with good programming, hit your goals. Your current numbers are novice so you definitely have room to move + the potential to gain weight.

Good luck to you, man!"
powerlifting,"Just switched last week-ish. It works noticeably better, so I just need some time to get used to it and iron out the minutiae of foot positioning and not defaulting to a weird wide-stance sumo."
powerlifting,Have you tried training the opposite stance?
powerlifting,"My best squat is 250kg, my best conventional deadlift is 205kg.

I am not built in a way that really works well for conventional pulls."
powerlifting,How much did it cost? I have shoulder issues too and would like to find out if it can be treated with PT or not
powerlifting,"&gt;I‚Äôll look into that Reactive system. Wow, I never thought of doing a 90% plus lift each week. I generally don‚Äôt have joint pain, but when I get into heavier loads things start to ache the day after. What kind of volume precedes that heavy single and how long do you keep that up? Do you compete?

Important point for me, is i start my first block pretty light.  
Working back from what i want the last single of the four 2 week micros to be.  
I add 10lbs each micro, and then start the next block with the weights from the 2nd micro of the previous block.  


So the singles early in the block aren't a true 90 or 92%  
One thing i started doing recently is making those singles early in the block into doubles once i felt that was an easy double.  
I did 470lbs X2 (best pull so far has been 490.5lbs) and was scheduled to PR my deadlift on Sept 30th.  
I picked up a somewhat significant back tweak while squatting on August 19th.  
I've been back on regular training since the very end of September.  
To be fair, i pulled 455 this week for the top single, and that actually is 92.8% of my best so far.  
But i really don't bother with finding my e1RM as i go.  
I like just working the pattern and being strong before a meet.  
My ""auto regulation"" is things like deciding to double the early singles.  
Maybe it's a caveman approach, but i just like working that pattern.  
Using RPE has never been attractive to me, but i'm not discounting its value for people.  
I just like trining te way i do.

But for me, having a top single once a week is something i'll likely always do.  
I'm always in touch with where my strength is, and  having the practice on singles  on a regular basis works for me."
powerlifting,"Wrestling and a little rugby is all I can think of.  But I was getting frequent separations just from routine lifting, repetitive use.  I have a collagen deficiency disorder, complicating things."
powerlifting,"Wow, that‚Äôs highly encouraging!  You really persevered!  Appreciate you.  I‚Äôm inclined to get it repaired if that‚Äôs what it takes to recover fully."
powerlifting,Yeah repeated dislocation could do it
powerlifting,Any ideas what‚Äôs up with that?  I did have bilateral distal clavicular excision.  I was getting repeated separations.
powerlifting,Thanks man.  Do you mean as opposed to giving PT a try first?
powerlifting,"Damn. Assuming your flair is up to date, half your total is your deadlift"
powerlifting,Took me 7 years to deadlift more than my squat LOL
powerlifting,"Loose chondral bodies and articular damage at your age, surgery is likely a preferable option."
powerlifting,"What gets me is not the RC tear. You‚Äôre a 51yo lifter, to be honest your other shoulder probably as an RC year too. Like the vast majority of people over 65 have an RC tear. The chondral loose bodies is what gets me. Not a finding I see that often on the humeral head."
powerlifting,there it is! i understand the preference now. i was hardstuck on the idea that flat is better so i couldnt even think of the possibility. thanks!
powerlifting,"I'd love to pay it forward, please post links to y'alls future meets and I'll tune in!"
powerlifting,"I think he put on a lot of flab. 

He was gonna do strongman but now he's older and with injuries and fails i think he said he'd rather cut for health and do bodybuilding and then retire. His bodies shot from being so absolutely massive for so long. (Not that'd he wouldn't still be big).

He probably wants to do a big final ish blast with some bodybuilding cycle stuff to gain as much lean muscle as he can on his bulk back up then hit it and dip. 

I think he wants 805 bad just to piss off zamani even though he thinks zamanis fake. 

He already got a training 795 so no way he'd give up"
powerlifting,What would be the point of him cutting if he still has his sights set of 800?
powerlifting,"I exist, unfortunately"
powerlifting,"Ah that makes sense that the calculus becomes more complicated. I'm 31 (29 when I fell rock climbing, destroying my shoulder), and I felt like that was a LOT of years of athletic life ahead of me that I would be effecting by not operating. At the same time, 51 also leaves you with a lot of athletic years ahead as well! Finding out that I had such a severe injury that was not going to heal on its own was a really rough thing to come to terms with. I'm sort of glad I didn't fully comprehend how serious the recovery was going to be-- it truly took the full amount of time that they said it would, but also the promise of a full recovery was indeed met. I was rock climbing and over head pressing the bar six months after surgery. Six months felt like eternity, but I'm glad I did what was needed to give me back my shoulder."
powerlifting,5‚Äô7‚Äù (about 170cm)
powerlifting,Nice to hear!  That comforts me.  But I‚Äôm 51!  Still trying to discern whether a repair will be necessary to continue lifting heavy.  I‚Äôm assuming it will be.
powerlifting,Manlets
powerlifting,I had a full thickness rotator cuff tear repaired and subacromial decompression. It was two years ago and I am 100% good now and benching more than before the operation! The recovery sucks for the first few months but I have zero regrets about having the surgery done because I would have been resigning myself to having a bum shoulder for the rest of my life.
powerlifting,"Strong is strong, even if you carried a little chub."
powerlifting,I also weighed 305. Ha! Thank you though.
powerlifting,And that‚Äôs some impressive benching!
powerlifting,"Inspirational and much appreciated.  I‚Äôve had a ton of repairs, but never had an RC tendon that was seriously torn.  Both long head biceps tendons full tore and that was NOT a fun recovery my brother.  Hopefully this one is no big deal like all 3 of my SLAP repairs."
powerlifting,"Anecdotal experience; I had mine repaired in October of 2020, and was back to benching 405 (to a 2BD) by mid-March of 2021. I took my PT very seriously, and did everything they told me to do at home. It really didn‚Äôt set me back at all."
powerlifting,I pulled 820lbs in early August then picked up a slight trap injury. Rehab was a success and I just pulled 800lbs and feel happy to bw back on my quest to pull 900lbs.
powerlifting,Much appreciated!  Frankly I‚Äôm shocked that I‚Äôm still able to bench as much as I can given the severity of the tear.  Wife is a GP and she thinks I‚Äôll need it repaired if I wanna keep doing my thing.
powerlifting,Athletic Trainer here: there is a lot that plays into whether you need surgery or not. Such as age and lifestyle. Surgery is also not always a yes or no question. A lot of doctors will try conservative treatment aka PT for a couple weeks first to see if things can be improved. With that said an 80% tear doesn‚Äôt sound good‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not 100% so there‚Äôs that.
powerlifting,You select lol. They have a wide range since they cater to Olympic weightlifters and weightlifters can use nearly anything they want on their knees. 7mm Hookgrip sleeves aren't as much pop as SBDs but the 9mms definitely are. I'd also size down if you aren't already. Inzer recommends XL for me for their sleeves and they're ungodly stiff but I still size down one for them to Large and size down two sizes for any other brand (HG/SBD etc) to Medium.
powerlifting,"Yeah, they've really tightened the screws on free users within the past couple of years."
powerlifting,"Oh, so it's a lucky dip with thickness, or do you get to select?"
powerlifting,"I would recommend Hookgrip sleeves, especially if you don't compete. They're about $50 from what I remember, last a long time, and are from 3-5mm to as much as 9mm in thickness."
powerlifting,are people who squat more than they deadlift real or were they just made up for a scary story for children?
powerlifting,Wait how tall are you
powerlifting,So late Feb 2023 julius is going for 800 again. Right now he's cutting to the very low 400s before bulking again. He's down to 420
powerlifting,Impressing people is dumb. Standing on the platform and performing to the best of your capabilities is an experience and a confidence builder you can't get in training. Do it.
powerlifting,"If  you're having trouble finding plates smaller than 0.5kg, you could make your own. Hardware store might have some 2"" washers, then glue em together til they weigh enough."
powerlifting,"I assume we're talking about conventional. Some people (me) might prefer squat shoes since the heel is solid and you can strap it in tight.

Squat shoes add an extra \~1/2"" of ROM and it changes your positioning by a few degrees. But it's such a small change that it really doesn't matter. Flats versus Heels are just preference."
powerlifting,I saw you! Kicked ass!
powerlifting,"So I sent a video over to an athletic trainer friend, and it turns out my positioning is all sorts of ****ed up haha.

Bar too low, chest down, butt wink. Based on my hip/ankle mobility he was saying that the normal stance with squat shoes is probably best once I fix the above issues"
powerlifting,Started donating plasma for money. Anyone do this and notice if it has any effect on your training? Looking to go twice a week.
powerlifting,"i use wrestling shoes‚Ä¶ i guess your idea is correct here - squat shoes are def more solid, maybe thats his preference lol the well praised converse shoes also has some squishiness in it, so i guess that must be it"
powerlifting,I'm aiming for that sweet sweet 500kg total but idk if I can
powerlifting,Then be prepared to add at least another 40/20/40 to your total. I'm sure you'll add even more until your comp!
powerlifting,I will Be. Gonna next compete in july
powerlifting,"If it were helpful, you'd see a lot more people doing it. I've met literally one person who preferred it, and I think that had everything to do with being an Olympic weightlifter rather than any benefit to the deadlift. Most people need to focus on getting pressure even across the foot, not on trying to shift forward and get more quad activation."
powerlifting,"Near impossible? I don't think so. Given your numbers, i think that's realistic, specially if you're running a peaking program."
powerlifting,"I think a good rule of thumb is to opt for squatting in flats unless there is strong reasoning behind the use of a heeled shoe (restricted ankle joint from surgery, performance discrepancies/inconsistencies favoring the heeled shoe, etc). 

Odds are if going flat felt immediately better/more balanced out the gate, that's probably the way to go. 

Treatment focus for improving hip impingement (assuming this finding is correct) generally revolves around restoring symmetry, strength and involvement of the glutes during movement. There's more to it but maybe the flats helped incorporate more glute during movement and helped your symptoms? Maybe the loading of the R knee changed with the L hip being more involved during the squat and caused some discomfort from actually loading your legs more symmetrically? I can't really say for sure but if I was your coach I would want to keep exploring flats.

I wouldn't change anything else though, maybe your stance felt more comfortable wider because it's similar to the trunk angle you were getting narrow and in heels? If it's really awkward to squat with a similar stance in the flats, I would try allowing yourself to bend over more, let your chest fall a bit more than what you're used to. A drill you can do to help find this position is to do a squat to depth with the barbell on your back, try to explore trunk angles/foot angles where you can hang out balanced in the hole without effort but are able to maintain optimal depth."
powerlifting,It has very little
powerlifting,How much whip does the bar have? It's fairly common for whippy bars to pull people forward. Overall though it looks good. Afaik balance is just sometimes a risk with sumo.
powerlifting,"&gt;Should I try the wider stance but with squat shoes? 

Yes. If it helps you, make a list of all the different configurations of how you can squat (wide stance/flat shoe/toes out, wide stance/squat shoe/toes out, wide stance/flat shoe/toes forward, etc.) then spend a day in the gym trying everything out. Make notes about how each position feels. The only way you are going to be able to hone in on the issue and what corrects it is to keep playing around with your form until you find what feels strongest and doesn't cause discomfort."
powerlifting,"Basically they should be stacked over your hips. So yes, not hunched over or slouched. Depending on your deadlift positioning/technique you may need to actively pull them back at lockout."
powerlifting,"I think there are tradeoffs between having something with an incompressible sole versus being in a slightly different biomechanical position. If their other option is trainers, then they may prefer the squat shoe for the more solid connection to the ground. I personally prefer pulling in a flat shoe, even if the sole is a bit squishier than my lifting shoes, but other people have other preferences. I doubt that there is anything beneficial from pulling in them though if you have deadlift slippers."
powerlifting,That's 5/2.5kg a month so it should be pretty easy. You'll probably have that in 6 months.
powerlifting,"My hot take/anecdotal observation:

I think this is a rabbit hole and I don't think it's a good idea for 99% of lifters. I think there is some validity for the trade off of sacrificing hinge mechanics for positioning. But this causes the deadlift to shift away from the hinge spectrum of movement and towards knee extension.

I think there has been an over glorification of quad focus for raw powerlifting, (don't get me wrong this is definitely the way for raw for most people) but it's caused a shift AWAY from hinge focused movements like the GHR and glute focused 45 degree back extensions (I was really surprised these variations were treated like some sort of hidden cheat code recently on IG at least). I think this is why we are seeing more people (especially the newer generation or people with &lt;5 years of experience) opt for the controversial ""cheating"" combination of figure 8 straps, straps being used to hold the weight in the finger tips, deadlift bars, deep dish plates, etc. You're able to turn the deadlift from a hip hinge into knee extension.

BUT

The window for success to demonstrate peak absolute strength becomes smaller because consistency drops dramatically: Peripheral factors make a much more significant impact on absolute strength on a given day. Are your hips tighter than usual because you're in a difficult portion of training or you sat around most of the day before training. Is the barbell a stiff bar or a deadlift bar? Is it an ohio deadlift bar or a kabuki deadlift bar? How broken in is the bar? Are the plates comp calibrated plates, deep dish or thinner pound plates? Are you using carpeting with a deadlift bar? The list goes on.

 I also feel like lockout becomes much more of an issue for the deadlifts in the knee extension spectrum because there ends up being such little emphasis on hinging/hip extensors. Small variables that can change even a few degrees of hip flexion when the weight breaks the ground ends up having a profound impact on leverages when so few degrees of hip flexion are involved to begin with.

More of my .02, too many people opt for ""knee extension sumo"" lately because a large number of people in powerlifting don't have the ability to demonstrate the skill or understanding of hinging/pelvic/thoracolumbar mechanics while moving a loaded barbell. This causes more people to shift towards a knee extension emphasis because the skill floor for knee extension is much higher compared to hinging. I think on average there is a surface level understanding through the regurgitation of buzz words on social media but at the end of the day, hinging just isn't executed well on average.

I think it's something that you need to experiment with to see if the trade off of poundage over consistency is worth it. I feel like lifting in the long term becomes less fun when so many small details can affect the outcome of your performance/mood if you go to far deep down the knee extension rabbit hole. 

In my opinion, you need to get SIGNIFICANT poundage to trade consistency."
powerlifting,"i guess the answer is it depends, but in terms of my personal achievement, it was realistic"
powerlifting,"is using weightlifting/squat shoes helpful / beneficial to deadlifts‚Ä¶..? i know a guy that deadlifts with it, its none of my business so i dont tell him, but it looks like his coach is okay with it, too. what am i missing here?"
powerlifting,"My hot take on the SSB, also painting with broad strokes not knowing the entire context of current/recent training history: It depends.

I think this depends more so on what is the limiting factor on deadlift progression and what benefits you feel the SSB provides over a traditional straight bar.

In terms of improving base line strength, I don't really think it is going to provide some sort of magic stimulus that a straight bar squat wouldn't provide.

Personally, I program the SSB for myself and others as a tool to punish poor eccentric control/mechanics at the trunk, a work around for shoulder impairments or a secondary variation through the training week so you're not just murdering the stimulus of only doing comp squats every session.

I think people that say it improves back strength significantly more than a straight bar are just doing tons of work with poor eccentric control, bracing/trunk mechanics, aka doing a lot of ""squat-mornings"". When I use it, I find it to feel between high bar and front squats in terms of the musculature being used and positioning when everything is on point (also depends on the brand of ssb). It absolutely taxes my back more if I rush the session, don't warm up properly, etc.

If you're looking at increasing your deadlift I would look at some other low hanging fruit first. Assuming technique and mechanics are not a limiting factor, are you neglecting direct accessory work in any areas, like hamstrings or glutes? Whens the last time you've pushed a high value accessory such as a GHR, SSB good morning, etc? Maybe you actually need to be doing less, etc, etc it depends. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: SSB ain't magic but it ain't bad"
powerlifting,Really fantastic job at this meet. Thanks for dropping a hint that it was streaming -- it was a pleasure to watch the meet and root you on in real time. I'm really glad to see you walked away with some WRs. You kicked ass out there dude!

powerlifting,"damn, didn‚Äôt expect a reply from the man himself. I‚Äôll definitely give that article and the app a look, i‚Äôve been looking to move away from MFP for a while now. It was great when I first started out but over the last year or so they‚Äôve made half of the previously free options into a paid upgrade and i‚Äôm just not paying $20/month for an app that does nothing for me other than showing me what food i‚Äôve logged."
powerlifting,"Lockout on that deadlift must have felt like it took *days!*

Congrats!"
powerlifting,"Congrats on coming away with a lot of accomplishments, and what a meteoric rate of improvement since April :) Not sure if your comment to the head ref on bench about hating her for it was serious, but from my own refereeing experience at high-level meets I for one don't think you were either shafted or gifted by the ref on that press command.  Regardless, glad you made up on deadlift to achieve your overall goal--it's to your credit as an athlete that you can rise to the occasion even when there is a setback and do what you came for!"
powerlifting,"The amount of arms snapping in Multiply is waaaaay less than the number of quad tears in raw. I've only ever seen 2 people break their arms benching in poly, and both were &lt;132lb females. I'm sure it has happened more often but I've been around for 15 years and have seen more than two quad ruptures this year alone."
powerlifting,I know a lot of SSB evangelists claim it will help just about everyone - but I am curious if folks who have incorporated ssb squats into their program have seen noticeable impact on deadlift
powerlifting,"I guess it depends somewhat on how you're defining nutritionist (unregulated term, so people do all sorts of stuff under that umbrella), but MacroFactor does more-or-less what a ""macro coach"" would ‚Äì instead of just setting you up with some initial targets with the hope that they're ""good enough"", it'll adjust intake targets over time based on your actual intake, your goals, and how quickly you're gaining or losing weight.

powerlifting,"Great post! It's tough planning training as one gets older, since there are far fewer resources for old people who are still lifting decent numbers than there are for younger lifters number of most coaches are used to traing as most other old people aren't lifting of our peers in age aren't lifting at the same level and younger training partners at similar strength levels can handle a lot more than we can."
powerlifting,"&gt;plates will come about an inch off the floor all by itself

Jamal is the best example of this imo. Beautiful form, increases slack pull throughout the wedge, plates hover b4 he even initiates the pull. Textbook sumo form"
powerlifting,"I mean, if you have a very specific technical reason for doing it in a sumo variation then that would make sense. However, if you're doing it just to do it or to get more work for your posterior chain then a conventional variation would allow you to work through a much longer range of motion."
powerlifting,"Props. 100% aweosme


You are only 18?!

How do you get to 637? 

Did you wake up one day at 16 and start deadlifting at 200kg on day 1 and just added 5kg a week to all your lifts until this competition?
That's truly insane."

powerlifting,"I trained SSPT singles for a long time just after my novice phase (DOH grip exceeded) ended.  
I started pulling hook immediately after DOH, and the all singles method very much helped me learn to set my grip.

I've used the SSPT template since then as a ""re peak"" when i had a new meet a short time after another meet."
powerlifting,"I'm curious about the target demographic here. The CCP and various subnational government entities give a shit about weightlifting, but outside the state recruitment/training system there isn't that much weightlifting going on.

powerlifting,"I just posted a reply to OP.  
I'm in the same boat in regards to doing regular heavy singles.  
I really like that approach."
powerlifting,"61 here.  
We definitely have different approaches.  
My best so far is 222.5 kg at 91.1kg bw  
I train with a heavy single every week, followed by 5 sets of 4  
I start the block at a point countbackward from where i want the last heavy single to be at the end of the block.  
So starting relatively light.  
It's a 2 week micro, and i stack 4 of those together for an 8 week block.  
The last single of the last block being done before my taper for a meet.  
So my whole process is the peak, i suppose.  
My last single should be good for my 2nd attempt at the meet.  
I like the confidence of having pulled that already before the meet.  


This probably isn't a great help to you as you approach your test with a very different method, but i figured i'd share since we are a similar age, and it could just be something to compare to.  
I cannot picture myself not doing singles all along.  


Good lifting to you.  


  
This is my program for DL  
For a long time i used a secondary day of light snatch grip DL, but i have dropped that now.  
It was 4 sets of 5 with 55% week 1 and 60% week 2  
WeeK 1  
90% single  
5 sets of 4 with 75%  
Week 2  
92% single  
5 sets of 4 with 80%  
The % is only of the number plugged into the spreadsheet, and i juist do 10lb jumps each micro.  
That results in (after the initial micro) each week 1 single being a repeat of the prior week 2 single, but with lighter working sets week 1.  


For subsequent blocks, i just start with the weight from micro 2 of the prior block.  
This results in only the last micro of each block being heavier than anything in the preceeding block.  
So overlapping the loading block to block.  
Bit of a built in deload.  
The A/B structure of the micro being somewhat of a mini deload each new week one."
powerlifting,"Something I forgot to mention - A Chilean lifter pulled 280 after I didn't go for it for the last pull of the meet and smoked it

Gave him a huge hug after and told him he's a hero. His wife (?) told me he doesn't speak English. 

I said to her - it doesn't matter, he's strong :)

She translated to him and it was an amazing moment"
powerlifting,"Hit the gym, Lawyer up, Delete Instagram."
powerlifting,Great work.
powerlifting,"RTS uses RPE to modify the training loads. The first heavy lift has an RPE of 8 or two reps short of failure. Based on how that first lift goes, RTS recommends modifying the training load. As a rule, I don't modify the loads. 

Prior to peaking, the deadlift portion of training might include a single followed by  3-5 sets with the number of reps decreasing over time. 

RTS has a free app which I starting using before purchasing one of their adaptive templates. If one purchases the template, RTS will load sets and reps based on how the prior week went. From there, I add a small weight increase to the staring weights. After the completion of the template, RTs will repeat the process for no charge."

powerlifting,How to get over my unhealthy crush for Jessica Buettner
powerlifting,"Been getting issues with my squat. I've always done low bar, because high bar is very uncomfortable on my traps for some reason.

Normal/narrow stance with squat shoes- this is what I typically do, but I get hip impingements on my left side pretty often.

Wide stance w/ flat shoes- tried this today, felt way more comfortable in the hips, and felt more muscle engagement. Still hit well below parallel. The problem is my right knee didn't like this. I played around with foot angle and it seems like a more straight foot gave me the least knee issues.

Should I try the wider stance but with squat shoes? Or is there something else I should look into?

For what its worth I pull sumo very wide with zero issues (sumo deadlift is by far my best lift). Should I just aim for a similar sort of movement for the squat?"
powerlifting,"Oh, my gym doesn't have those, so I'd have to order some, but looking for 0.25 kg.plates wpuld make more sense."
powerlifting,You can wrap ankle weights around the bar for anything under 0.5kg. I think most are adjustable so they can be whatever weight you want.
powerlifting,Blake lehew really thinks so and he's a ATWR holder so I would test it out for yourself
powerlifting,"I‚Äôll look into that Reactive system. Wow, I never thought of doing a 90% plus lift each week. I generally don‚Äôt have joint pain, but when I get into heavier loads things start to ache the day after. What kind of volume precedes that heavy single and how long do you keep that up? Do you compete?"
powerlifting,Huh?
powerlifting,Greg Nuckols says the main factor is hip structure and you don't know until you've tried. You'd need to practice sumo consistently for a few months at least to effectively rule it out as your stronger variation.
powerlifting,"I am a couple of years older with similar deadlift numbers. I don't see anything wrong with your approach. You've been lifting long enough to know what works for you, so my thoughts on how to peak are less likely to be better than what you have decided.  I'm currently following a Reactive Training Systems peaking program, which incorporates at least one single in the 92 to 93% range each week, so I'm not especially apprehensive about attempting a 1RM."
powerlifting,"It's the cue I've had the best results with, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHfS05aGsQ8) is the video that made it click for me. Eddie Hall uses the cue [""imagine yourself in a leg press""](https://youtu.be/4NyJPgBUREw?t=345), that seems to work for some people as well."
powerlifting,YuSAPL
powerlifting,"Honestly all of that. I think I really benefit from having someone program for me, it helps me to not max out as often as I was (which was leading to injuries and slower progress). It takes all of the emotion out of programming. The technique changes have also been a huge help as well. 
While working with my coach a little over a year I‚Äôve went from a 515 deadlift to a 620 (just barely missed 634 in competition)‚Ä¶ I used to be on steroids a few years ago, I‚Äôm two years off of it, and I‚Äôm way stronger now than I was in gear."
powerlifting,Do you think there is a reasonable reason to sit down just a little bit to get higher torso angle during a sumo deadlift ?
powerlifting,I'm still mad my USAPL Yugoslavia page got banned
powerlifting,That's really good progress. Interested in this approach as I'm close to 500lb. How many times a week do you deadlift?
powerlifting,"I‚Äôve always just worked to a heavy triple and then done back off sets. Usually aim for around 70% average intensity but some days are higher. Good mornings are great for lower back, rows/front squats for upper back. Also think there‚Äôs great benefit in using both stances. Have pulled 210kg and 230 respectively, using conventional and sumo at 70kg"
powerlifting,Was was it about a coach? Was it the technique checks? The programming? Mindset? I've been considering getting one myself.
powerlifting,The problem with that is you would get red lights in competition squatting to parallel. So I would say no. It's like switching out deadlifts for block pulls because you can do more weight.

Sometimes you'll see people doing that on warm ups and the plates will come about an inch off the floor all by itself (with either stance).

Jamal is the best example on this. Beautiful form, plates hover b4 he even initiates the pull"
powerlifting,Deep squats are great but this guy was asking why his squat 1rm went down and how to make it go back up. Cutting your depth to powerlifting standards will increase the amount of weight you can squat 1 time.

I did 475 four years ago at 170lbs and I just want to see if I‚Äôve still got it. This may sound crazy to younger lifters, but when you get older I think you‚Äôll understand. There‚Äôs something about deadlifting that I can‚Äôt explain and if I don‚Äôt do it, I just feel off. That heavy single four years ago was hard and I guess I‚Äôve been afraid to go heavy again. Anyway, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can suggest a better way to peak in one month than what I‚Äôve outlined above?"
powerlifting,"Oh nice the first time I‚Äôve seen this thread.

https://youtube.com/shorts/5qjl2YCBsAk?feature=share

Just wanted to request a form check on my paused deadlifts. 210kgx3 RPE 6 (think it goes to 465lbs)

I‚Äôve been trying to make my deadlift lockout cleaner, usually I overextend my lower back a bit in order to try manufacture a lockout in heavier weights. Think the lockout looks much better than usual when I pause."
powerlifting,"A world record? Holy shit, congrats. Now I just want to see you compete at 90kg or 110kg, whatever you prefer."
powerlifting,Ankle weights would work.
powerlifting,"I did my own programming for a handful of years and it was pretty valuable, i definitely saw results, but I will also say that hiring a powerlifting coach is the thing that gave me the most progress as an intermediate lifter"
powerlifting,Don't see anything glaring in your video. I'd say overall that's pretty solid sumo technique. Maybe try experimenting with slightly different toe angle and see if that improves balance at all
powerlifting,pondering doing my bulk food shop at aldi or lidl. decisions deicisons
powerlifting,Might want to consider getting shoulders behind the bar or in line at least. I tore my lat because of similar positioning to you. Your lockout is almost hitching I think but is need a different angle.
powerlifting,"long arms are just advantageous since it decreases the distance we have to reach down to the bar‚Ä¶. long torso is disadvantageous since it increases the said distance. same idea with legs lol. so at this point, i somewhat understand that it has to be about ratio of one‚Äôs body, but i am just too unaware to give u useful information to provide you with the reason for these whole ratio things and biomechanic.. others should def chime in before i say wrong things lol there charts available, which still doesnt make sense to me.

i just simply think if you have hard time reaching down to the bar, sumo might help you, but no necessarily. but obviously better to try both‚Ä¶ ive trained both until recently i kinda ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to sumo, since it was more natural to me. dont feel ‚Äústronger‚Äù with it, though‚Ä¶ i have long arms and average torso and according to my ‚Äúratio‚Äù, i should be doing conventional‚Ä¶ idk. the whole ratio thing feels more gimmicky to me. theres def more to choosing between the two than the ratios i think"
powerlifting,"Thank you! I suppose so. everyone i know seems to be always on some program, so i feel left out but im glad to know that this is an acceptable step!!"
powerlifting,Do it.
powerlifting,"nope, did not sound like it at all and no need to apologize. maybe i could go check it out, i mean, all ‚Äúprograms‚Äù are bound to look like one another i guess. ive been on 5x5, madcow, 531, and realized my bench was 205 while deadlift was 405, figured i would focus on bench a bit more lol thanks"
powerlifting,"I'm not trying to shill here but it's going to sound like it and I apologize. Your freestyle program sounds a lot like Sheiko programming and exactly like the stuff I'm doing with Sheiko Gold. I didn't want to pay for it but I have two young kids and between random nights where they don't sleep or constantly bring home colds, it's nice to just let the app give me a workout based on how good or bad I feel and factors in if I missed a few days."
powerlifting,"[EliteFTS has an article on that](https://www.elitefts.com/education/choosing-conventional-or-sumo-based-on-your-bone-structure/)



I spent 6 months, on two different occasions, trying to switch to sumo. I'm just not built for it, I think 545 was the most I pulled sumo and my conventional was in the low-600s at the time."
powerlifting,Experimenting with your training is the first step to figuring out what works for you üëçüèº
powerlifting,"hi, I have a problem that I carry with the sumo deadlift, during the whole movement I feel very stable on the center of the foot, but once the repetition is closed when I am standing still with the bar in my hands I do not feel stable, as if the my body falls forward and I feel the weight moving to the forward part of the foot, where is the error in my form?


https://youtu.be/DJ5jxMWFXeU"
powerlifting,"If you pull sumo and wanna train stiff legged deadlift as a variation, would you train this in a sumo or conventional stance?"
powerlifting,I would recommend it. You will probably have a great time and meet some likeminded people üëçüèº have fun!
powerlifting,"So, for progressive overload, is 2-3% the increase you should aim for? I got some fractional 0.5 kg plates for bench as it takes me forever to add just 2.5 kg. It's too soon to make conclusions, but so far the 1kg increase felt better. However, that would be more than 3% for OHP, I couldn't find smaller plates than 0.5kg when I ordered."
powerlifting,Silly strong pull
powerlifting,"There's a friendly competition coming up at a gym a little way away from me (I have to take a ferry). It's in 3 weeks.

I've been training for about... err... 16 months? And my conventional training PR is 220kg right now. I haven't done any kind of prep or anything (found out about this yesterday).

Would you guys say it's worth going just for the experience? As I am fairly certain I won't be impressive up there haha"
powerlifting,"
&gt;long arms and short torso generally favor deadlift itself

Isn't it the other way around with torso? People like Ed Can have really quite short legs compared to their torso."
powerlifting,"Use the low handles, practice bracing hard and pressing the floor away from you. Doesn‚Äôt need to be a complicated thought process. Like the other comment says, your knees will have to come forward to initiate leg drive."
powerlifting,"Fair, maybe I'm just seeing ""back tension"" when it should be more lats."
powerlifting,"Not to disagree pointlessly but I don‚Äôt see much, if any lower back rounding at all here. Since his back position/angle does not change throughout the lift, I don‚Äôt think he should force himself into an unnatural overly ‚Äúneutral‚Äù position. I agree about the lats though, would probably help create a smoother lockout"
powerlifting,I'm not sure that bounce of the weight against the floor would fly in competition.
powerlifting,"Thanks! I reached out to them. If not, maybe I'll just awkwardly ask a stranger to record me :|"
powerlifting,"generally speaking, and to a certain factor, i heard/think so. like femur length &amp; your torso length on and on‚Ä¶ but ive been doing more research and there are also suggestions saying that its much more than that, like the way your hips are structured, how your muscle has developed over the years blahblah. 

torso and femur length stuff i understand, but it dont make too much sense. long arms and short torso generally favor deadlift itself, i would think, but then femur‚Ä¶ long femor is disadvantageous to deadlift in general. like wtf?

theres more to this just than leverage of these ratios &amp; lengths. i think‚Ä¶

having said that, even if we assume that you have the ‚Äúbody you need‚Äù, stick to whatever is comfortable for you! it also might be your training factors; if youve been training conventional, i dont think you can expect to just be good at sumo after many tries - need to intentionally train for it, including stretches! those damn hip flexors, hurts when first sumo-ing. sumo has tendencies to require more techniques to bring it up to your level"
powerlifting,"What are the actual skeletal factors that make someone better at conventional or sumo? Femur:tibia ratio or something right?

I've tried sumo so many times but can't get anywhere near my conventional 410"
powerlifting,"Right as you set up you bumped the bar forward.  Slow down the setup right before the lift, and use that time to really get your lats engaged and the lower back flattened.  Im seeing lower back rounding that corrects at the very end. I know you're probably in a peaking template, but if you can get some time doing pause and deficit deadlifts, those do a lot for maintaining strength at the very beginning of the lift."

powerlifting,"Just want to say your squat form looks good. I watch a few squat university videos and the things I look for is bracing, knees over toes, neutral spine and minimal to no butt wink at the bottom. Solid squad form and depth :)"
powerlifting,I did not start loving the deadlift until I started pulling sumo. It just feels way more right for my body and allows me to do it with better form and no pain.
powerlifting,"Isn't it good to have deep squat depth from a hypertrophy standpoint? I've always seen channels like Clarance Kennedy, Candito, Squat University that says deep squat is best for overall strength and hypertrophy."

powerlifting,"Two more days until my first ever purposeful deload, and I can feel that I sorely need it! Recovery is getting rough. 

In the past my mental health was so bad that I just went off the rails and stopped training for a while once every month or two, and that was enough üòÖ now that I‚Äôm stable I‚Äôm able to keep pushing myself apparently. 

Can‚Äôt wait to have some good recovery, and can‚Äôt wait to get back into it after the deload week and prep for my meet! Getting so close and I‚Äôm so keen."
powerlifting,"With a trap bar, you‚Äôre not going to get any drag. You‚Äôre just standing in the center and reaching down. Your knees are gonna to come forward as they would with a conventional deadlift."
powerlifting,"I've had nothing but high quality products from Titan with excellent customer service.  


They've got a *broad* range of products with clear descriptions of how still or flexible or anything else relevant so it's very easy to find what you need.  I've got a pair of Titaniums I've used for squats for a bit over two years and they're holding up great."
powerlifting,"My program prescribes trap bar deadlifts as an accessory (3x5 @rpe 6). Within a powerlifting context, am I supposed to set up and perform these as though it's a regular deadlift with the barbell starting a bit higher and ""dragging"" it up my shins, or setup in a way that allows me to move the weight most easily/efficiently (e.g. allowing my knees to come way forward through an imaginary barbell in the middle)?"
powerlifting,"i stopped following a program. i just go to gym every other day, do bench each time and alternate between squat and deadlift. 

my tested max is 505. i warm up with triples on deadlift upto 495, do some singles until i kinda cant or begin losing form, then go down to 405 and do amrap. seen massive progress so far, with this type of ‚Äúprogram‚Äù. i feel like i still have newbie gains left. this type of scheme helped me go from 455 to 505 in like two months. idk why it works, but now that i just go to gym and kinda push myself, its a lot more fun than trying to follow a program. i mean, my scheme is prob flawed/inefficient, but i am glad im having fun!"
powerlifting,You know some people have to lift octagons instead of circles.  Appreciate what you have. :)
powerlifting,"If you watch a meet (look up a previous year's USAPL Nats on youtube), pay attention to everyone's 3rd squat, you'll see everyone slow down right about that same point.  Just keep getting stronger and never stop trying to improve your technique like everyone else."
powerlifting,"It's kind of like winding up before you wedge your hips in and extend that back, build tension and all that.  The weight pulls straight down at your shoulders so to your body the weight is AT the shoulders and you're wedging your hips *under* the weight.  If that helps you visualize what's happening easier.

Sometimes you'll see people doing that on warm ups and the plates will come about an inch off the floor all by itself (with either stance)."
powerlifting,"Your upper back rounds a bit and your chest is pointing down.  Bend your arms a little in your setup after you brace and rotate your elbows around into your side like you're grabbing a pencil in your armpit and keep your elbows screwed into your side, pulls your shoulder blades down with your lats (which is also what the pencil bit is about).  Pull your chest through and use the bar as leverage to pull your lower back flat.  It sounds like a lot but it's all more or less one smooth motion and feels hella natural when you get it right.

Bending your arms like that at the start will give things in your back more freedom to get in the right place and keep it locked in as you straighten your arms build tension on down the line.  Sometimes it's a little easier to feel it if you lower it back down while keeping your back extended, lats locked down, etc."
powerlifting,"I get what you're saying, this is probably also why I don't feel my hamstrings as engaged in the lift. Will try and do this next time. Is it as simple as just sitting slightly back?"
powerlifting,Honestly been fine. tho being honest none of my third attempts were rpe 10
powerlifting,How has the recover been feeling since then? Just a few more days and you can get back into it!
powerlifting,HAHAHAHA i wish gabby martinez had an OF
powerlifting,Feel free to refer to the [SBS How to Squat guide](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-squat/#Diagnosing_Weaknesses) which delves into the biomechanical reasons why you are weakest at the sticking point. The solution is just keep working and recognize that it's normal.
powerlifting,"So my deadlifts have been pretty good lately, hit a PR of 405 roughly a week and a half ago but my friend noticed that there is a slight round in my lower back on my heavier sets right when I‚Äôm about to pull and my lower back does get a bit sore after deadlifts. Did a 380lbs top single today but my lower back is rounding. any tips for my deadlifts so my lower back does not round? Please and thank you :)
Setup:
- Feet placement around shoulder-width
- hook grip
- imagining trending the bar to engage lats

powerlifting,"I was specifically trying to do pauses during my squats today, yea. But I definitely think mentally I‚Äôm just beating myself up over it. Definitely going to incorporate some more variations, maybe pin squats etc."
powerlifting,"It is pretty common for someones deadlift to be much higher than their squat. It has a lot to do with how you're built- nothing right or wrong about it. I think you're getting in your own head about a non-issue. 

It's possible doing some speed work with your squat could help. Check out the video for some good info on how/why to do speed squats. 
https://youtu.be/gnkMU9jelmI

Also, do you intentionally pause your squats in the hole like that or is it just something that happens? That will certainly make your squats harder."
powerlifting,"I'm usually fried for at least a few days after a meet but I feel like I can lift and do stuff by the middle of the following week.  No chance I would do sbd in that week but doing some light lifting like curls, chins, leg extensions, that sort of thing feels good imo"
powerlifting,"üëç will do, honestly just probably need to train more and push myself"
powerlifting,"Looks fine, keep at it."
powerlifting,Oh interesting. Just only seen on my friends who do sumo. Can't wait to try sumo monday
powerlifting,"Conventional too.

Just one of many ways you can setup to create tension."
powerlifting,Why in sumo do lifters lift their bum up and then put it down before lifting? Is it to pull slack?
powerlifting,"I think mentally I thought my feet were a bit off balance and I have a tendency to shuffle a bit midset trying to correct that which obviously is a bad habit.

As for moving my head I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean other than me looking at my feet or at :46 when someone caught my attention and said hi, which obviously I mean I get what you mean there. 

Also I‚Äôm not actively ‚Äúnot trying‚Äù to accelerate, my squats just genuinely feel and look very slow.

I think I‚Äôm just frustrated because my squat is significantly lower than my deadlift and I can‚Äôt pin exactly why but it feels like I have no drive in the squat. 225, 255, 275, or whatever I‚Äôm squatting, I feel like it always just is so slow and feels so grind-y. Hell even on my warmup sets sub-200 lbs my squats are slow, but they‚Äôre not ‚Äúhard‚Äù. It almost feels like I can‚Äôt build up the tension in the squat to really accelerate and push harder.

Sorry for the tangent but it genuinely is just perplexing me and it has been frustrating recently"
powerlifting,Thanks. Bromley has one of the best YouTube channels currently
powerlifting,Hope you‚Äôve hit multiple PRs too
powerlifting,"I'm not really seeing anything unusual. Slight slowdown where most people experience it slightly above parallel but nothing particularly extreme.

I do wonder why you're messing with your feet, wobbling around and moving your head so much. After walking out and setting your feet, they shouldn't move again until you re-rack. Same with your head. 

Your bracing looks to be lacking, even with the belt.

If you did have a specific and pronounced weakness at the midway point, I would suggest pause squats at that point, pin squats from the same point, and just generally pushing harder. Your goal should be accelerating through the range of motion. It looks like you are trying to coast to the top of of stretch reflex."
powerlifting,App is incredible used it for multiple programs now.
powerlifting,"If you have ever done a Pendlay, or deadstop row, it's very similar except you don't bend your arms. Essentially, you mimic what your back would do in that row - squeeze the shoulder blades together and depress or 'tuck' the lats down toward your butt. If you combine this with (slowly and slightly) dropping your hips, it naturally lifts your chest and pushes your hips in toward the bar to create immense tension on the bar and into the floor.

To reiterate my earlier post, though, a cue is simply there to get you to do the right thing."

powerlifting,"Funny you specify multiply. With a few exceptions (as always), multiply lifters oftentimes have their hands near the sleeves either due to mobility and/or to allow a more vertical torso position.

I was going to get down to about 165-170 lbs (currently at 183) and take a break for a month or so, but I‚Äôve been thinking that if I can get down to about 178 for Thanksgiving and 173 for Christmas then I could probably stretch this thing down to 160 before I take the break because Ill be eating at maintenance basically the entire weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve to New Years. 

The goal is just to be around 150-160 for my wedding April 1st and I think I can get that without too much struggle. If anyone has any sort of tips to doing that I‚Äôm all ears!

powerlifting,"Are there any online training journals of elite lifters that show session loads along with subjective rating? 

I'm an S&amp;C coach. I love studying powerlifters because how quantifiable their sessions are in terms of volume and intensity. For the past year, I've been pulling apart lift vault spreadsheets to see how relative intensity changes with volume reductions. This has been a good exercise for me to visualize phasic potentiation as well as see in practice how planned volume loads match scientific training principles.  

Now I'm looking for qualification on top of quantification. We know in reality actual sets/reps prescribed are not the same as performed. Therefore I want to study not just cookie cutter programs but also actual training journals of elite lifters. I would love to see John Haack's daily workout log!  Do these sources exist for elite powerlifting athletes?"
powerlifting,"You are probably rounding your upper back more than you used to. It makes getting the bar off the ground easier, but harder once you get to your knees.

You also look lean - perhaps you could try a more aggressive surplus? I know you like to gain slow, but it also sounds like lifting gains are pretty important to you too! I'd highly recommend tracking at least a few days a week - I like to go be feel too but it's very hard to gauge a small surplus correctly.

Technique looks great by the way, good job! That deadlift was like RPE 7! Have you considered low bar squatting? I switched from highbar recently and my progress has gone through the roof.

Good luck!"
powerlifting,"Jumped from the RP diet app to MacroFactor, and I absolutely love it. 

Helped me drop from a fat 88kg to a lean (er) 75kg, and it felt like it was effortless. 

Chilling at 77kg for another 3 weeks enjoying food before probably going down to 72kg before starting my bulk. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 

Food wise, grab yourself one of those meat hammers. Butterfly your chicken breasts and then pound them until they‚Äôre maybe an inch thick max. Fry on high heat. Actually juicy chicken breast, soft, tender. Amazing."
powerlifting,Any exercise recommendations for my weak point being in the knees halfway in the lift on the deadlift? I've never had a problem with lockout and have been focusing these past months on deficits and they've helped immensely.  Now my new sticking point is at the knees.
powerlifting,Are you suggesting that holding 325kg halfway down your back by your fingertips with your forearm bent behind your arm is not sustainable?
powerlifting,I don't eat anything which means the animal had to die. So no gelatin or flesh of an animal. Anything else I'm fine with.
powerlifting,"Lentils, beans, dried soy chunks. It‚Äôs really easy. Getting enough calories in, now that can be tough."
powerlifting,I bet no of the current french team will be competing at worlds 2027.
powerlifting,"Nah, you have to ask someone to do it for you 99% of the time."
powerlifting,"No of course not but it‚Äôs nice to keep a squat pattern, at least I have found this to be true and the novel stimulus from switching from a LB to HB for a period of time can be beneficial to progression."
powerlifting,"Yeah I agree. Nobody needs to stick solely to high or low bar.

I do think the ankle mobility could actually be a limitation for him. Especially where he hasn‚Äôt tried squatting with lifters on (giving him the ankle mobility that might be the missing link)"
powerlifting,"Awesome. Thanks

And I guess, yeah, my glutes are being used but I'm always going on my toes and my.knees cave in on high intensity squats"
powerlifting,"Actually, not using your glutes properly can affect your form a bit. I used to have some problems because of that. As you said, it's no doubt they are using them, but what I am saying they may not be using them enough. I personally think all they need to do is focus a bit more on pushing theough their heels. This fixed the issue for me. I had some issues at the lockout, probably when the focus shifts to mostly glutes.

But yeah, if they don't experience any form issues and they just want it because they don't feel their glutes that much there is no need to change anything."
powerlifting,Just make sure you push through your heels when you squat if not activating your glutes properly prevents you for achieving your potential in squat. You may want to practice this a bit at a moderate load first. Maybe try it during a volume squat session. In time you'll get used to it.
powerlifting,Dynamic style?
powerlifting,Vid?
powerlifting,"I‚Äôve finally fixed my hydration (I used to just sweat all night and barely drink water... kind of sucked!) and so now I am just a fiend for salty foods. All the vegemite I could ever want, adding salt to every second thing. Performance results have been fantastic! Lifting more and cramping less. And now instead of retaining water like mad and bloating I just sweat like crazy. I love it. 

Anybody have any good simple salty food suggestions to mix things up? Vegemite and pickles have been great. And I do have electrolyte supps and just plain old salt for when I really need it."
powerlifting,"May I ask what your diet looks like and what your current protein sources are? I've been vegetarian (with the occasional inclusion of seafood) for almost a decade and even during deficits getting some 130-160 g of protein was typically a non-issue. For example, a tub of low-fat cottage cheese or quark/topfen can have 25-30 g of protein, greek yogurt will land you somewhere similar and those servings aren't even particularly large. There's also eggs and soy and whey powder and beans/lentils and stuff like textured vegetable protein from soy or peas. Even stuff like milk in coffee and whatever protein is in your grains or plants add up to an amount that shouldn't be underestimated. None of these will break your bank either.

It may also be your macro targets and that you've set your protein goal unreasonably high. Especially in a surplus there's little reason to increase your protein artificially (unless you just intuitively end up eating more protein due to preferred eating habits) as opposed to maintenance, considering you are in a state of high energy avaliability anyway and run very little risk of losing anabolic stimulus from the diet side of things. Secondly, protein isn't a preferred fuel source for the body, so you're probably a lot better off getting your surplus mainly from carbs anyway."
powerlifting,"Friends, hiring a photographer. Sometimes you‚Äôll have someone recording the event at a local meet, but that‚Äôs not always the case. Your safest bet would be to ask someone there to get footage/pictures"
powerlifting,Oh and also making a HSP with air dried chicken chopped up and spread over potato gems with Tzatziki
powerlifting,"I make ""cheesecake"" by blending a tub of cottage cheese in a ninja until smooth with 1/3 of a sachet of diet lemon Jelly,  and pouring it over Granola,  letting it set overnight."
powerlifting,"Can you specify don‚Äôt eat meat? Vegan? Vegetarian? Ovo-lacto? Etc.

Seitan, tofu, adding nutritional yeast to food, lentils, etc all kind of fall within a similar price range sometimes if you‚Äôre comparing beef or chicken. 

I‚Äôll also add that I feel that generally speaking people are overestimating the amount of protein they actually need in a decent amount of cases based off of some antiquated bro science (full disclosure graduated with a nutrition degree) . If you‚Äôre in college a consideration (if possible) is getting a job at a food place that serves similar food that you eat to potentially cut down on the cost."
powerlifting,Eggs are great.
powerlifting,"Can confirm, instead of bothering to change to high bar, I just keep my low bar squats and just added hack squats and front squats, and my quads are... okayish."
powerlifting,How do you get footage/pictures at a meet? I am going to my first one and I don't really know anyone who can take photos/videos for me... can I assume that staff will record and take photos during the meet that I can just view later?
powerlifting,Triple decker peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a healthy serving of peanut butter (972 cal/51 g fat/33 g protein/106 g carbs). I make my own peanut butter mixed with peanut butter flavored protein powder which ups the protein content.
powerlifting,"Dunno where you are at, but if you are on the west coast of the US, Grocery Outlet has a bunch of reasonably priced protein powders including stuff that is vegan friendly. But if not I agree, one can only eat so many beans and nuts."
powerlifting,Power bank.
powerlifting,What's your favorite relatively healthy foods for on a bulk?
powerlifting,I am the same size and I like the maxbarbell essential slippers that are super thin and sock like. Xero Prios are good for ultra thin and flat soles but with laces.
powerlifting,"&gt;And ~~that extreme low bar guy at the Arnold~~ the French, in general"
powerlifting,Close stance folks - do the KTB handles smack your legs?
powerlifting,getting ready to do the bulk of the century and my god its so difficult to hit protein when you dont eat meat and are a poor college student damn
powerlifting,No especially if we‚Äôre talking about a more dynamic style OHP. Usually it‚Äôs about the point where your elbows are almost parallel to the ground and the bar is  just about to pass your head.
powerlifting,Awesome thank you!
powerlifting,"GM, vertical shin box squat, and rev hyper seem to carry over to squat better for me than rdls but your mileage may vary"
powerlifting,And that extreme low bar guy at the Arnold who dropped the bar off his back without even squatting lol
powerlifting,"I got them and made a world of difference! Definitely worth the investment

I will say tho; i read on a comment on this thread that notorious lifts might be better if you're of the wider foot. Cant validate that 100% but i my feet are pretty narrow and the a7s fit pretty snug"
powerlifting,Eh. He might not be right but also doesn't need to ever squat high bar - assuming in this hypertrophy phase that he is doing other things that target quads. Back squatting in general is not the best way to target quads.
powerlifting,"When squatting heavy, my friend/spotter noted that close to failure, my one knee and shoulder sort of twist forward/knee slightly in while the other side pulls back. Is this a core stabilization issue, abductor/glute med thing because of the knee thing, or just some other imbalance between sides. For the record, I can do roughly the same number of BSS/pistols on each leg"
powerlifting,"Some wild shots based off your info. Some of this is my assumptions and some are facts. 

1. You are sinking your squat. I bet your 305 was way more shallow. 
2. You are very lean so you could definitely gain weight.
3. You are very aesthetic for your size and strength. That is partly because you are so lean but total shot in the dark here that you favor hypertrophy way more than strength work. I know of way stronger people than you who look way less good than you do. 

So basically cut your squat depth, stop having body dysmorphia and gain up to atleast 185 and spend less of your total workout time working on those guns and I promise your squat will go up."
powerlifting,"I‚Äôm an AU women‚Äôs 10, which roughly converts to about a 41, and I ended up getting 42 (all my local supplier had in stock on a really good clearance sale). Fit feels loose but comfy. Not slipping around inside but not the most secure given the lack of laces or thick material. So I‚Äôd say generally they run to size, with a good bit more toe room than is standard. For most people no need to size up or down like some brands. If you have REALLY wide feet, size up one and they should be great. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend that if you wanted to run around in them say for strongman or something as it won‚Äôt be as secure around the ankle and back of the heel - but for powerlifting that‚Äôs not a concern. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have any issues if they‚Äôre a tiny bit too big IMO."
powerlifting,"That makes a lot of sense.

And for PC work I would assume RDLs? It's been a loooong time since I've started taking lifting seriously again cause the pandemic really fucked that up for me so I forgot a lot"
powerlifting,Extreme low bar/extreme tight hand placement thing is so messed up.  No reason we should be seeing arms snap in raw powerlifting (multiply guys - you know what you signed up for)
powerlifting,Second meet this Saturday. Hoping to hit small PRs on all three. Any unexpected tips? Someone told me to take a power strip just in case there‚Äôs no outlets close enough to you.
powerlifting,"Might be true, might not be. I firmly think sticking somebody solely in high or low bar based on one factor isn‚Äôt really a good way to go. 

He might genuinely struggle with it no matter what! I personally have super long femurs and find high bar the most comfortable. BUT when I started out and had poor ankle mobility it was an absolute nightmare for me, There are about 5 or 6 different parts of your body that impact what stance is most comfortable. Maybe high bar really is near impossible for him! But it isn‚Äôt a universal rule for everybody with long femurs."
powerlifting,"Thanks for that feedback! Any insights on sizing- following their recommendation, sizing up or down, etc.?"
powerlifting,Tried benching with deadlift slippers today as opposed to my heeled shoes and definitely felt a bit more rooted to the ground than usual
powerlifting,Not being optimally built for high bar and not being able to high bar are definitely two different things
powerlifting,"I have wide feet (for my size) and I have found notorious lifts to be very wide and they are not constricting or tight at all. 
Others might have good (or better) suggestions, but I can say notorious lifts are good for wide feet at the very least."
powerlifting,Don't try eating something new.
powerlifting,""" he made new account it's probably better not to mention the account name here.""

No worries. 

Thanks for reply."
powerlifting,"Cheers. Thanks for explaining it better. 

I think some troll circle jerk assholes took aim at nsuns. But I never understand why."
powerlifting,"Awesome thanks! I didn't know about NewSuns

The links on r/Nsuns are indeed dead and have been for some time. I always get ""you need access"" 

Also this is what I was talking about when asking ""what's the story""

The trolls. 

I checked out newsuns and first thing I see is ""This sub has been overrun by trolls and filth from r/fitnesscirclejerk and the mod refuses to do anything about it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I get trolls, I get circlejerks on reddit, but what I don't get is their problem with nsuns"
powerlifting,Bromley just did a video on the 4 best strength programs from this App if anyone is interested
powerlifting,They seem good but haven't trained with em yet
powerlifting,How do you like them? Thinking about getting a pair.
powerlifting,His YouTube videos answer that - he's been dealing with injuries.
powerlifting,What are you squatting for? 1rm or glute activation?
powerlifting,I also got third! Granted there was only 93kg people but hey it's something
powerlifting,"So I have a friend who is running a hypertrophy phase currently. I suggested maybe considering cycling high bar squats for a while to put some stimulus on the quads. However he claims he can‚Äôt high bar squat because of ‚Äòlong femurs‚Äô. The question is, valid reasoning or poor excuse for shitty high bar technique ?"
powerlifting,"It's all good! My numbers were totally mediocre at my first comp, but I was proud as hell of myself for even doing it, and the fact that I got 3rd just means I got a souvenir to show for it. It's hanging in my garage to remind me to go get silver next time."
powerlifting,"Two things that have worked well for me:
-walking forward and stepping laterally with a hip band style resistance band before lower body days. 
-  few sets of dimel deadlifts with an empty bar or 95 lbs prior to main work, focusing on the cue, ""glutes to bar, bar to glutes"""
powerlifting,Depends on how much bloat you‚Äôre used to training with
powerlifting,"You're very welcome!

I also become depressed taking time away but I've learned that I do need it. You could also take a deload week and see how you feel after that. My deload is in 2 about 2 weeks (2 weeks after I come back because I'm still recovering). It's definitely something a lot of us have to learn.

I haven't tried the Calgary Barbell program but I've heard it's good. For 5/3/1 I really cranked up the intensity, especially on my upper body days. Instead of just the 5/3/1, the 5x10, and then the accessory, I put in other exercises. For example, on my bench days, I do the 5/3/1, then 5x10 at about 45% - 60%, then my 5x10 rows of my choice, then I'll throw in shoulders and some more smaller isolation movements. But with deadlifts, I can only do my 5/3/1, my 5x10, and then my 5x10 of an accessory of my choice. Also, since my squat is lagging, sometimes I'll go in the gym and just do 5/3/1 of squats and leave and that does the trick. There's lots of ways you can go about doing the 5/3/1 and it's about what's right and suits you.

Leaving will be difficult for a little, but it will probably leave you more satisfied in the long run because you will be making progress. I was more frustrated with the gym than anything when I was plateaued and regressing, but these past few weeks making progress have been awesome and very fun!

Best of luck!"
powerlifting,"Just got a ssb and am loving it. Obviously I can just swap it in a normal program, but am curious if there are any programs that use it heavily as written. Thanks!"
powerlifting,"Not worried abt missing weight this weekend, anyone got any breakfast recommendations?"
powerlifting,"Do a 16 week program, eat enough to gain a lb a week.  Test or do a meet at the end.  At that point, if you are fatter then you want to be, diet for a bit and lose some of the extra fat. Just try to hang on to as much strength as you can, understanding that it may go down a bit. 

You'll likely gain more than 16 as you'll retain some water.  I started at 181 and got up to about 200 after 16 weeks on my last program. Put 45 lbs on my Squat, 20 lbs on my bench and about 50 on my deadlift. I am around 180 again, but much leaner.  I'm weaker right now but that's how it goes.  I plan to start a 16 week meet prep after Thanksgiving, and plan to gain at least 20 lbs.  Maybe I'll stay there if I don't get too fat."
powerlifting,"Thanks so much for your well written comment. I appreciate the offer of messaging you and I may take you up on that. 

I actually have thought about taking an extended break to recover physically and mentally, however, despite my difficultly in making progress I do really love the gym and if I am away too long I tend to become depressed. I did take a decent break recently while I went on vacation for 3 weeks, unfortunately i didnt really feel all that great or energetic when I got back into it. 

I was considering trying calgary barbell programs, the free 8 week, I didn't know they had a 12 week also. I have tried 5/3/1 in the past but I do really bad with low volume and low frequency. 

Mentally itll probably be very difficult to leave the gym for an extended period but it is definitely something I will consider since it is somethign I haven't really tried, and I'm glad to hear it does work."
powerlifting,"Here are some context clues I edited into my original comment:

Squat: https://youtube.com/shorts/SjLHZowb00U?feature=share

Deadlift: https://youtube.com/shorts/6Ff9XltAK-U?feature=share

Picture: https://i.postimg.cc/d3LfjX82/IMG-5615.jpg

Right now I am gaining very slowly. I do have an extremely hard time gaining weight but I would say a solid 5 lbs in a year which over a few years I feel adds up significantly?

I'm 5'9"", I probably get around 150 g of protein a day. 

I definitely have some other symptoms of low T, mainly things like low confidence, low mood, mental fog, tiredness, etc. I do believe it is affecting my life negatively although that I just a theory of course. 

I usually follow my programs 95% of the way. The only things I really do are add some more arms volume and sometimes if I am feeling extra good a certain day I will do a few more reps on my last set. In my latest program (TSA 9 week) I was doing about 13 sets of bench a week spread over 3 workouts, 9 sets of squats over 2 workouts, and 4-5 sets of deadlifts in one workout. 

I've done plenty of hypertrophy phases especially in programs like J&amp;T2.0, I actually have tried not to do too many peaking style programs as I am not competitive and also like to gauge my strength in more ways than just my 1rm."
powerlifting,"Thanks for the feedback. That is one thing I'm concerned about- in general, it seems like most slippers are fairly narrow, and I have big/wide feet. I deadlift socks-only currently, but I know my gym's staff hate me for it (lol), so figured slippers would be the next step. I've read a lot of good things about Notorious, but did see a few Reddit posts on them breaking fairly quickly."
powerlifting,"Thanks so much for your comment! I am just curious about the gain 1 lb a week thing. I do hear that a lot, but doesn't that mean you will cap out pretty quick in bodyweight? As in, I still want to be at a ""healthy"" bodyweight, so If i gained 1 lb a week, in just 5 weeks I would be at 180 lbs. What happens after? I assume at some point you just can't gain anymore weight, so at that point there must be ways to still make progress? I am very slowly gaining weight right now, but even if I were to maintain my weight, should I still not make progress over time? 

surprisingly i actually do feel like I look like I should be able to lift more than I can XD. But i definitely can work on getting to a higher bodyweight. Thanks for your advice :)"
powerlifting,"Hey thanks for your comment. I'm 5'9, 159-160 lbs. 

I used to track calories for many years but nowadays I go by ""feel"" as I've gotten pretty good at knowing when im eating enough or not. I also weigh myself each morning. 

I've gained like 10 lbs of solid weight in those years and for me I like gaining say 5 lbs of good weight in a year. 

I edited my original post with these too but here are the videos:

And thanks I try not to worry too much about my test and its good to hear you have made good progress having similar levels. I will say one thing though that some people can get really strong with 400 ng/dl and others can't with 800 ng/dl. As in, genetics also determine how effectively you're using that test."
powerlifting,"I used the A7s for 6 months but the toe box is very tight on them and the toe burst open. Notorious lifts are great, really grippy with a wide toe box."
powerlifting,Wouldn't the normal sticking point for ohp be in the bottom though? Like the first few inches
powerlifting,I like seated strict press against bands cause I feel my ohp doesn't fail at the bottom anymore but as you said above the head.
powerlifting,"I actually got several sleep studies done to rule this out and although I do have mild sleep apnea I was consistently asleep for like 90% of the time and usually in bed for 8-9 hours. Thanks for your kind words, I do agree I have to accept my genetics and I wouldn't mind if I was making progress even very slowly but the issue is that im progressing backwards at this point :/"
powerlifting,"Don't need to deload to bar, it's a very small problem if a problem at all. Like lel4rel said you can do box to focus on yourr posterior. Try standing a bit wider and don't let your knees go forward when box squatting."
powerlifting,"Looking for advice/feedback on a deadlift slipper, namely, I'm choosing between the A7 slippers, Lifting Large Ground Lock, and the Notorious Lifters. I pull conventional, and I'd most likely need the largest size slipper, if that matters (US size 14 shoe).

Appreciate any insights."
powerlifting,Squat to a box is the tried and true way of getting more posterior chain.  That and just making your PC stronger so your body doesn't try to avoid loading it when you squat
powerlifting,"Steve Donovi, Marcellus Williams, and Joey Flex are some good people to look at on the Tube.

Books, The scientific principles of strength training, The Muscle and Srength Training Guide, Powerlifting Foundation and Methods, and the Reactive Training Manual. 

If you want to really dive into stuff, I'd suggest the Emerging Strategies Classroom. Once you  dive into that, everything starts to make a little more sense. It did to me anyway. It's expensive, but worth it if you're in it for the long haul."
powerlifting,"Glute activation during deadlifts and squat is just internet chicanery and there is 0 reason to deload to bar.

Your glutes are responsible for completing hip extension. It is physically impossible to do a full squat without activating your glutes."
powerlifting,"Thanks for the input, I'll keep the slight deficit for as long as it will let me maintain my lifts and start eating more if they begin to fall. 

Already pumped as hell to hit the current numbers in a meet. Appreciate the grounding!"
powerlifting,"Does anyone have any recommendations for exercises to help with glute activation in squats?

I've come to realize that I put it all on my quads and hip adductors and I have very little posterior chain activation. Ive deloaded to just the bar and bodyweight squats and I just can't seem to quite get the activation."
powerlifting,Agreed
powerlifting,Lol I wish. My goal is just to cut 10-15 lbs depending on where I feel is enough and then get back on a strength block ASAP.
powerlifting,Just keep bulking and never stop
powerlifting,"Most people look at popular programming by reputable coaches, find one that fits their goals/schedule/equipment, and then follow it as best they can. They then make small adjustments over time. (adding volume, adding exercises, or dropping certain stuff that doesn't vibe with you) but you can generally follow the principles of the original program just the same. 

[Copy The Smart Kid's Homework](https://purplespengler.blogspot.com/2019/05/copying-smart-kids-homework.html)

&gt; There is no reason for most trainees to delve into programming principles or exercise and nutritional science."
powerlifting,"I've been lifting since I was 13 so lets see if I can help.

I was an athlete for my first 4 years of lifting and after I quit to become a powerlifter I hit a plateau. I was trying to get back into barbell lifts and they were all stuck. This is what I did:


I got off my own programming. I had been programming my own workouts for about a year at this point. I needed to humble myself and realize I didn't have all the answers and that I need help. That doesn't sound like a problem for you.

Next, I took a very long break. I took a 5 month break. I lost strength and size during those 5 months, but I needed that rest badly. I agreed that I wouldn't lift until I moved so I could lift stress-free. Your break doesn't need to be this long, but I recommend taking a bit of a break, atleast a month.

Once I went back to the gym, I put myself on a 8 week retraining cycle. I just went in and slowly tried to work up to my previous maxes. It worked. I can provide more info about how I did it if you would like. Basically just take the time off and then however many weeks you were off, divide it by 2 and thats how long your retraining cycle is going to be. Test those maxes again to get solid numbers to program off of.

I was choosing between 2 programs, Jim Wendlers 5/3/1 and Calgary Barbell 12 week program. I chose thr 5/3/1 because the cycle only lasted 4 weeks and it is very versatile. I agreed to give it 2 cycles and see what it was going to do. I chose the Boring but Big template with my own twists to fit my weaknesses. I can go more in depth if you like. I would give that program a shot or 2.

With the Jim Wendlers 5/3/1 program, I added over 30 lbs on my bench, 60 lbs on my deadlift, and 40 lbs on my squat in almost 2 cycles (I had to hit pause because I got a really bad migraine and it made me really tired so I took a rest, but I am trying to get back on track to finish my last 2 weeks). Highly recommend that program because of these results. 

If doing that method doesn't work, try this method that also helped me. It's called the 80/60 Drop Method. Basically, take 80% of your 1rm and do 3x5. After that, drop down to 60% of your 1rm and do 3x17. It should help you break your plateau.


Overall, I think you need to take atleast a month or 2 off. It's not something to be ashamed of. Your body needs to recover and it sounds exhausted if it's regressing like that. Think about running a marathon everyday, you're going to be exhausted and need atleast a weeks rest after that. I am taking a week off because I got a bad migraine and I just needed to have a good rest. I took a whole 5 months off to regroup and recover. I really needed that. If you are still having issues, just contact me for more advice because those 2 methods aren't the only 2 that I know. I've experienced plateaus and regressions and it's just part of the experience. Hopefully that helps."
powerlifting,Can‚Äôt remember who it was said ‚Äú nothing has changed regarding training in the last 100 years‚Äù seems about right tbh
powerlifting,"A friend could do it if they're experienced. My wife, who also competes, is always my handler and it makes a huge difference. I can just zone out to my music and she lets me know when it's time to focus up."
powerlifting,Got a little chunky leading up to my last meet after maintaining and then going on a YOLO bulk for a bit. I forgot how tough this is!
powerlifting,"Sticking point is kinda an outdated mode of thinking for any lift, OHP included.

Unless your sticking point is created from really really suboptimal positioning, 90% of the time you're just not generating enough velocity to accelerate through the movement (i.e. not strong enough)"
powerlifting,"[Alexander Bromley](https://youtu.be/4QV_mtT5-lU) has some decent information, that specific video touches on all the basics.

Personally, I don't think beginners should do their own programs. Run 3 different programs and see how your body reacts to different rep ranges and intensity. Then if you feel comfortable with it, make your program but base it on whichever of the 3 you liked best."
powerlifting,Juggernaut Program Design Manual is a great place to start.
powerlifting,"They basically take on as much of the mental load on meet day as they can so all you need to do is lift, not even think about the weight on the bar!

You can totally have a friend do it.  Frankly, it would be really helpful for me just to have someone else fill out my attempt cards.  My hands shake like hell after heavy lifts, I'm mostly just thinking *BREATH!* so dealing with numbers right then sucks, and the slip of paper is tiny.

Just make sure you talk it over with your friend so you're both on the same page.  They don't have to do everything a good handler does but the more they can take off your hands the better."
powerlifting,"I thought I did but it turns out to mostly be a sciatic nerve problem so some nerve flossing and a lot of the same mobility stuff for hips (pigeon pose, figure four stretch, lunge stretch, etc) helps with that too.  It can be more than one thing too!

It turned out to be helpful for me to see a PT about it to narrow down the cause(s) and get movements tailored to my specific issues."
powerlifting,"A good handler is someone who is going to just point you to the bar to lift when you need to lift it. But even a bad handler can help load plates when you tell them to, and that can be helpful as well.

There are different levels to handling, to be clear:

Elite handling: This is someone who is going to do research to put you in the best position to win/get a record. They will know the rulebook backwards and forwards, will have researched not only you, but your competitors, and will be ready to ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù with strategy. You only need this at high level meets and if you have a true chance to win/competition for a record. The ones I know charge between $100-300 plus travel

Good handlers: This is someone who also is going to know the rulebook backwards and forwards, but will be there to best support you in your day. They‚Äôll time your warmups, have a convo with you in advance about goals, and base your attempt selection on how it moves. They will watch the board and point to the bar when it‚Äôs time for you to take it, load plates for you, and make sure you have everything you need. This could be helpful at the local level, especially for your first meet if you‚Äôre not comfortable. You‚Äôre probably looking at anywhere from giving them a gift card for their trouble on up to $100 if it‚Äôs a really experienced coach.

Adequate handlers: this is someone who may be clueless about what‚Äôs going on, but they can be there to be your emotional support/loader. They‚Äôll be someone to talk to in between sets, someone who will give you what you need when you ask for it, someone who loads your plates for you. Basically, just a buddy who wants to hang out with you for the day. I normally still give these guys a gift card, but they‚Äôre free.

I think the biggest thing for your first meet is if you can find a good friend who also knows the rules, you‚Äôre pretty set. The biggest thing is that you want to make sure it‚Äôs not going to be someone who stresses you out, but will be there to feed off your energy for the day‚Ä¶ calm you down when you need them to, make you laugh when you need them to."
powerlifting,"&gt; There was a whole sub dedicated to the Nsuns program

It is still there, with links to the program in the sidebar:  /r/nSuns/  
Or you could go to /r/newSuns/  which has all the programs in a stickied post called ""NSuns Resources"""
powerlifting,"The templates are still out there if you look (pretty sure the r/fitness wiki has them). 

nSuns nuked the dedicated subreddit because he believed the type of discussion that was happening there was not productive or helpful to anyone. Most of it was hyper fixation on what accessories should be used because the program leaves them open. 

This was probably related to his general frustration with the massive amount of spam he got about the program. Reddit got kinda weird about it and he got some strange DMs."
powerlifting,"Its probably a combination of managing intensity and volume better, but also specifically working on improving hip IR on the side that lacks it, thoracic rotation mobility for the direction that lacks it, and so on. 

With time I do think the leg that hurt probably got a bit weaker which in turn made it more injury prone."
powerlifting,Got hip pain and changed his squat to be insanely knee dominant and ended up with knee pain.  Brutal.
powerlifting,I love OHP(although I really haven't done much lately sadly) and my favorite accessory for it is definitely Z-Press.
powerlifting,"So did you ever manage to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù this asymmetry or at least just find a way to squat with an even stance or did you solve this problem largely by adopting an intentionally asymmetrical stance? 

Did you find yourself responding better to lower squat and/ or deadlift frequencies from a symptom tolerance standpoint and did you use some unilateral work like Bulgarians to make up for some of the volume?

Id also be curious about any movements/loading strategies that were better or worse tolerated."
powerlifting,"""How smart do you think Hulk Hogan is?"" He had a monster physique and strength level but if you asked him about working out do you think he'd sound half as pretentious as some youtube science fitness guy? It was never necessary to be ""smart"" for this hobby. 

The wealth of literature is either endlessly debating the stuff that worries people who are ""majoring in the minors,"" or it's just slowly debating and ultimately coming to the same conclusion about things that people who have put the time in the gym have already realized."
powerlifting,"That's really awesome to hear, appreciate all you guys' efforts!"
powerlifting,"Ive had it both sudden and gradual. For me it feels like there is a connection to asymmetry of my shoulders, leading to the hips twisting during deadlifts, which leads to asymmetries in both fatigue levels of my legs/hip extensors as well as asymmetry of development. And this in turn makes me squat with my right hip more internally rotated than my left. The left having to take out a lot of slack in external rotation making my itband very tight along my vastus lateralis. 

So specifically working on these tendencies seem to have helped. I had this pain for like five years but Ive been good for a couple of years now."
powerlifting,"If you can get one you trust, great. if not, no big deal. Just watch stuff like Juggernaut's ""Guide to your first meet"" so you're well prepped for what's going on."
powerlifting,Interesting thanks
powerlifting,"I do something similar to this, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq8LfZ\_o0rs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq8LfZ_o0rs), it works really well."
powerlifting,"In particular for the unilateral pain, what were the circumstances precipitating the pain, was the onset sudden or gradual, how bad was it, and what approaches did you take that allowed you to get through it?"
powerlifting,"Both one side, and both sides, at different times"
powerlifting,Unilateral or both legs?
powerlifting,Ive had all sorts of lateral thigh pain
powerlifting,He still posts on reddit quite frequently and doesn't really hide who he is but if that's the reason he made new account it's probably better not to mention the account name here.
powerlifting,Thank you very much for your hard work. I'd really love to tip you guys but I'm having some issues with money these days. Your app is much better than most paid apps
powerlifting,Anyone with IT band issues?
powerlifting,"If your sticking point aligns with the most mechanical disadvantageous position of the lift, then you are just saying that you aren‚Äôt as strong as you‚Äôd like to be in that movement. There are probably no specific movements that will help based on the information provided so the answer really is to just get stronger, and we can‚Äôt tell you how to tweak your approach because we lack the intimate familiarity with your training that you logically take for granted. 
Weak point addressing is more useful when you are discussing an atypical velocity loss that isn‚Äôt at the beginning or the typical sticking point because a normal sticking point is baked into any training discussion about getting stronger. 

And most of the people on this sub really don‚Äôt care about their overhead presses.

I‚Äôve found that the OHP responds to pretty high frequency personally but I haven‚Äôt trained it in a long time because, well see above."
powerlifting,Exactly the answer I was looking for - thanks for your insight ü§ù
powerlifting,"as sad as it is, and im sorry for talking so much lately, my medal i got for competing in my first comp is probably my most prized possession rn icl"
powerlifting,"A handler at a powerlifting meet is someone who is basically there to make your life easier as a competitor by taking over menial tasks. A lifting friend can 100% do it, but you'll want a friend that ideally knows how meets run or is at least willing to do some research to understand; otherwise, you might end up needing to babysit them too. I usually handle my friends at meets if they don't have a coach or if their coach isn't local. However, a handler isnt' 100% necessary, and you can absolutely handle competing without one if needed.

Here's what I do when I handle people at meets:

* Keep track of time, so they know how long they have for warmups, and the time between attempts. I'll let them know when they're on deck, in the hole, etc. 

* Load all their warmups, so they don't have to waste energy loading plates

* Have their water/snacks to give as needed. I'll remind them to have some sips of Gatorade every now and then if they're not having anything.

* Record lifts

* This one is preference based, but putting in attempts. Some people prefer not to even think about what weight is on the bar, so they'll either give me their attempt selection beforehand (usually +/- 5kg for 3rd attempts) and let me make the call, or simply tell me what they want after they walk off the platform and I'll go over to the judge's table.

* Other misc stuff: apply chalk on back, baby powder on legs, grab headphones before they go on platform, hype-ups or motivational speeches if needed. Generally try to make their life as easy as possible."
powerlifting,a handler does everything he or she can do on the day of the comp to make sure you dont have to do anything apart from moving circles
powerlifting,"In my option, no. Our goal in powerlifting is to maximize how much weight we can move on a single rep. So that top single is there to keep our comfort with executing the rep with a relatively heavy load there all the time. It doesn‚Äôt really matter if we become a little desensitized to high rep sets when going into a more intensity focused, lower rep phase of training. We just don‚Äôt want to lose our ability to handle relatively heavy loads when we do go back into a higher rep, volume focused phase."
powerlifting,"not helpful, get over yourself"
powerlifting,"A handler may or not be a coach but any friend experienced in powerlifting meets can help you. Handler duties depend on how high maintenance you are. Bare minimum, they load your warmup sets, help you time your warmups based on how quickly your platform is getting through the previous flight, and film your attempts to help you decide what to go to next. 

A handler that knows you pretty well can give you insight into what they think a good next attempt would be or even put the attempts in on your behalf without consulting you. That‚Äôs a good option if you psyche yourself out. They also procure snacks, foam roll, talk shit about other lifters with you, whatever you need. 

It‚Äôs nice to have one but you don‚Äôt need one!"
powerlifting,What is a handler? And do i need to hire one for a meet or is it something a friend could do?
powerlifting,"I used the A7 stiffs for quite a while, they are a bit stiffer/denser than the regular A7s but not really a game changer on that end, based on how people describe the Inzers there is not really a comparison to be made. They are just a slightly stiffer sleeve"
powerlifting,"&gt;What is the weakness

Physics.

That's just where you've got the least mechanical advantage so that's about the same sticking point for everyone.  You could maybe work on your triceps (or any other random perceived weakness) and get it to change slightly but it's always going to be there.

You probably won't find a lot of OHP experts here vs r/weightroom since it's not required for the sport and tons of people simple don't include OHP in their program or if they do it's an accessory and they give zero shits about their OHP max."
powerlifting,"Anyone have the new-ish A7 stiff knee sleeves? I have the original A7s and they work fine, but tried out a friend‚Äôs Inzer Ergo knee sleeves (you know, the ones that are basically knee wraps) and they‚Äôre insane.
Wanted to see how the A7 stiffs compare to the inzers. Thanks y‚Äôall."
powerlifting,"Wow thanks for these detailed suggestions. You sound like you know your stuff. Some of these we already have in the works, like being able to switch to a different exercises, adding in pre-calculated warm-up sets, and allowing users to build custom programs (simple at first, for V1). I'll talk to the team about some of the other features to see hich we can add to the near term roadmap."
powerlifting,"Totally. Trust me as a daily user of the app myself I'm annoyed by bugs. This is an inherent problem with building an app that has all these programs with vastly different structures, progressions, and customizations. That said, my team work 24/7 to fix bugs, so it has gotten much better over time"
powerlifting,"Sent you a PM to see if we can find a fix. GZCLP and nSuns are the only programs on our legacy infrastructure, which is more buggy. We'll be migrating these last 2 programs in the next few months."
powerlifting,"Yes, we will be releasing this feature in the near future! What's good (and bad) about Boostcamp is having all these programs with different structures and progressions in one app. And now we let users create their own workouts (and programs in the future). This makes aggregating data exports much harder than a simple workout log. So it is in the product roadmap, but will take some time as we have a small team."
powerlifting,"""deleted his account""
That makes sense. 

There was a whole sub dedicated to the Nsuns program. And it just stopped one day. The excel files of the program were no longer available. (I'm really glad I saved a few copies on my Google drive)."
powerlifting,"To OHP experts:

I still can't bench but I can OHP, been doing a few different variations, the standard, seated, seated from pins, push press.  Max seems around 80 - 85kg for all variations (bench was around 150 before shoulder issues) 

 I find with OHP I can really grind a lift for a long time  and the sticking point is always about just above the head, mid range I guess you could say.    What is the weakness and are there any accessories that help, thanks."
powerlifting,Awesome to hear my man. How's the coach working out?
powerlifting,"Ohh, thanks a lot! That sucks. Hopefully he'll be back in full health and strength soon."
powerlifting,Hey thanks for the bug report! I believe this is because we just launched a new version of the app with an onboarding questionnaire to suggest programs. Glad it's working! If you come across any other problems send me a DM.
powerlifting,"Hey thank you for the feedback! We definitely plan to make Boostcamp more customizable in the future. As you can imagine, making all these programs with different structures and progressions work under 1 platform is no easy task. But we're working on it!

What do you mean nSuns disappeared? nSuns is a Redditor lifter enthusiast who prefers to remain anonymous. I believe he deleted his old account because he was getting too many questions bothering him."
powerlifting,"Few things today. 

* I wanted to hit a 325 lb (147.5kg) for 4 reps today, I hit an easy 3 reps but my spotter had to touch the bar on the 4th. So I'm a bit disappointed there. 

* Seems like every time I ask my friend if he wants to hit the gym, he's got something going on. Feelsbadman.

* Anybody else listen to something like stand up comedy, podcasts, or books in the gym then put on some hype music for a big lift, then go back to the other? 

* If you had $50 to spend on powerlifting accessories what would you get? Like if you were buying a gift for someone."
powerlifting,"Bryce Lewis had some great story posts on Instagram yesterday speaking towards this topic. I do think the mental enjoyment of powerlifting programming comes from tinkering with little things like rep schemes, top sets and backoffs vs straight sets, accessories, etc. in order to optimize what works best for the individual."
powerlifting,I don't think he'd be able to keep hold of the bar with both his hands completely on the smooths without those straps; having his hands so close together increases bar bend which significantly reduces his rom/makes the lift easier. Imo it can't really be compared with competition deadlifts; definitely still a feat of strength and flexibility though.
powerlifting,"Straps + lb plates, not to comp standards."
powerlifting,Hell yeah I can
powerlifting,"RE: Sumo.  Couple of things not yet covered.  Paused reps an inch off the floor (be strict about it) are great to work on positioning.  Doing pauses with light weights and just holding it as long as you're able can be a way to feel out your ideal position.

I seem to see a lot of conv-&gt;sumo folks try to treat it like conv. with their legs wider.  You need to push your legs (the knees in particular) *out* instead of just *down*.  ""Spread the floor"" is the common cue.

You may already know this but stance width should be where you're strongest.  As wide as possible isn't necessarily better and changing the range of motion has nothing to do with it."
powerlifting,"Depends on the fed.  If the fed you'd compete in is an IPF affiliate, yeah probably.  If not, it depends on your gear and that fed's rules.

In either case, local meets tend to be a bit looser about it so as long as it's close enough the meet director might be okay with what you've got.

Best thing to do is to find the soonest meet you can compete in and sign up."
powerlifting,Yeah it's been a bit strange on his end lately. Still a rlly good coach tho
powerlifting,"""As of now, roughly 9 weeks out, I‚Äôm still unable to properly train my squat and deadlift due to a lingering knee issue. This compounded with the hip problems that have been plaguing me for a while have convinced me it‚Äôs time to take a small step back from the platform and not force a meet.""  From his post on insta when he pulled out from Commonwealth games"
powerlifting,"Any medical intervention has potential side effects, but if you're doing it right you're just bringing your body back to normal testosterone levels, which would be quite good for you. Some people overdo it and take themselves consistently to superhuman levels of test, which could for sure have negative consequences."
powerlifting,"Thanks for Boostcamp. Its awesome. 

Can you shed some light on why Nsuns disappeared and can only be found on Boostcamp now? 

I tried to google and search reddit for the story, it just seems like so many fitness and powerlifting circlejerks hate it and make fun of it. What in the world is the story behind it leaving the internet and only being on boostcamp now.  


If I could give any feedback it would be to make things more customizable. 

I love boostcamp and the ease of having it on my phone, but sadly went back to my old saved Nsuns excell files. I like to tweak some of the formulas for example. Front squat is always too high, so knock that down a bit, other lifts, or actually particular sets within a lift I like to knock up a touch."
powerlifting,"I used to wear these, they were perfect:

RockTape RockGuard Protectors https://amzn.eu/d/ele54Fg

I stopped scraping the bar up my shins so I don't bother anymore."
powerlifting,I am curious about this too!
powerlifting,"What happened to Bryce Krawczyk? I've been watching his videos quite a lot, but I must've missed something. He's either not been doing SBD at all or doing much lighter weights, has he got injured?"
powerlifting,"I plan to finally start attending powerlifting meets and comps, but I‚Äôm still confused on the rules for equipment i can bring to raw meets. I already have a belt, wrist wraps and knee sleeves, all from random Amazon companies. But do I really have to  buy all new ones from companies approved by the IPF"
powerlifting,"Also for me at least perfect form is basically impossible with just the bar for bench, and it would be so much harder to pull slack on a 50kg deadlift than a day 100kg deadlift"
powerlifting,"Great app thank you for your work!!  


A question that I always asked myself with such apps. Is there a possibility to export/download my data/workout history? Because I always wonder what happens to all my logged workouts if the app gets discontinued or doesn't work anymore etc... How can I then look back to maybe years of tracked workouts? I just find it interesting to look years back to know what worked for me at the time and I am little worried that with all those apps this will get lost in the future. I think I really have to write more stuff down on paper to eventually look back in a few years."
powerlifting,my a7 sumo slippers came. damn i didnt realise how high the soul of my vans was damn
powerlifting,"I think it would be useful if you included a bit of context about your training prior - are you completely new to barbell training, or have you been lifting for years but just recently joined this new club? Obviously very different answers depending on your starting point.

Sore can be okay if we're talking DOMS, or are we talking actual pains and aches which is less good?

At a basic level, with an example, if you have 100 units of recovery and you're at 85 units of training that's fine. But if you're at 100 or 110 units of training, that might eventually become a problem."
powerlifting,"&gt; But the intellectual effort put into making routines seems quite minimal in contrast to the wealth of literature about the topic. 

I disagree. Most studies are done in a limited timeframe with people who don't lift or barely lift. There are certain factors that do seem more beneficial than others *on average*, but when you look at individual data points from subjects it can vary a lot. Where most people tend to respond better to higher intensity training for strength, some people do worse on it and way better on lower intensity training. 

Most/all programs follow basic guidelines of periodization and programming, but individuals will respond better on program a than on program b while others do better on b than on a. That's why in the end you'll have to find out what works for you; more or less volume, higher or lower intensity, higher or lower frequency, maybe topsets work great, maybe you need to do hypertrophy blocks instead of running peaking after peaking program, maybe you need to improve your conditioning, maybe you need to increase or reduce rest times, find the variations that work for you etc."
powerlifting,"Does anyone else feel as if powerlifting is a little ""doltish""? I enjoy the lifts, particularly deads and the squat, and the grind (often) increases my numbers. But the intellectual effort put into programming seems quite minimal in contrast to the wealth of literature about the topic. 

To put it in Neanderthal terms, ""if number go up, keep doing it. If number go down or stay same, change it."""
powerlifting,And so does a coach and a great friend to put your plates for you.
powerlifting,So does a brain ;)
powerlifting,Thanks brother :)
powerlifting,"When I had the time, I used to sleep until I wasn‚Äôt sore anymore. This meant 9 hours on average. I felt great, and I highly recommend it."
powerlifting,And so does a plate counting website.
powerlifting,"I did 531 for 9 straight months at one time. At some point, I never got sore again until I stopped it."
powerlifting,Some programs just make you sore all week until the volume drops down a bit. I did Jacked and Tanned 2.0 and the first 4 weeks I was sore every single day
powerlifting,I think you‚Äôre probably right about some of it being muscles you haven‚Äôt used before or in a while. It could be your food intake overall but also how is your sleep?
powerlifting,"\&gt;is it simply because I have started using muscles I have never used before, and will go away in time?

&amp;#x200B;

this part yes"
powerlifting,I used the app before I got a coach and was very satisfied! Ran nsuns 5/3/1 and did pretty decently
powerlifting,"On your off days go for a few mile walk, ride a bicycle for awhile, or any LISS activity you like. It will help flush lactic acid. Alternatively you could google active recovery workouts and do those instead. Eating more will also help."
powerlifting,Are you getting enough rest and sleep? Sometimes you can lose strength if you're not sleeping enough. I would think of this as a life long journey rather than worrying about the numbers. Keep experimenting with your workouts and find the things that work well for you. Genetics play a huge factor in strength so the sooner you accept that fact and focus on your own goals the better your mental state will be. Not everyone will hit 700lb+ squat in their life time and that's ok. Just enjoy the journey.
powerlifting,"&gt; I've been very deliberately trying to just concentrate on very low weights and correct form.

That's a very good way to spin your wheels and not get anywhere. Your form at low weights and at weights approaching your max will look absolutely different and having a ""perfect"" (whatever that means) form with an empty bar will give you nothing at all when weights get heavier. The only time I got injured lifting was when a person tried to correct my squat form.

I'm not saying to max out every session, but handling heavy weights is a skill, so practice it."
powerlifting,"Your gym is teaching you yes?  Trust the system.  But be careful, if something feels not right, as in not muscle pain, you probably are doing things too fast; slow down the progression."
powerlifting,Is TRT bad for your body long term?
powerlifting,Hey any reason to push yourself is a good reason in my books
powerlifting,How long have you been training with them? It takes the body a while to get used to new movements. It will mostly fade
powerlifting,"I'm using it at the moment. I had a short enough training cycle that I had no hypertrophy block. All of the strength blocks have a good amount of the competition lifts, and the specificity (i.e. comp lift frequency) increases as you get closer to the peak.  


From what I'm hearing, I might not run a hypertrophy block next time - just set it for a short enough cycle to be strength-only (I think about 4 months)"
powerlifting,"Genuine question - is it efficient to pull the bar into your shins with such force that it cuts you?

If your shins have a slight forward angle, there will be a downward force opposing the upward motion of your lift. Even if they're not, the harder you pull into your shins the higher the frictional force acting against you.

Or does this mainly just happen when you have super sharp knurling and a wider stance? I pull narrow conventional so the smooth part of the bar contacts my legs."
powerlifting,"I used to be an elite swimmer and my calorie target was 6000(!) per day, so can hopefully help. A few insights:

* Mindset. Eating that much is going to be unpleasant. You have to treat it as a part of your training.
* There's only so much you can eat in one sitting. I had two breakfasts, one lunch, and two dinners with pretty much constant snacking inbetween.
* Liquid calories, as others have said. Shakes with full-fat milk, oats, peanut butter, bananas, honey.
* Butter and oil on everything.
* Fatty meats help you push calories up (e.g. 20% fat mince, steaks).
* You NEED to track. It's so easy to THINK you've hit your macros when you're really 2000kcal under.  


Good luck!"
powerlifting,"Sorry to hear you've been struggling, sounds tough. A few questions:

* How tall are you?
* Do you track your food intake?
* As others have said, if you could post some videos of your lifts that'd help

I wouldn't worry too much about the low T. I honestly don't think your natural level has that much effect on performance until at least the elite tiers. Mine is \~400ng/dl and I've managed to pack on a lot of muscle and progress well"
powerlifting,Yessss. But can you open a pickle jar tho
powerlifting,"I just gave it a go. I chose TSA 9 week intermediate and then it freaked out after I tried to create a login using my Google account. Closed the app, attempted the TSA 9 again putting in my maxes and it went through smoothly with me already logged in. 

On Android"
powerlifting,So does Juggernaut AI
powerlifting,"Thanks, will try that next training cycle. 

Conversely, would you also recommend doing a higher rep lower intensity back off set during a high intensity/low volume phase?"
powerlifting,Have you tried specifically the Stiff model? I feel like not many people know they sell those (because they're available in fewer colorways).
powerlifting,"Can you link some of your form checks? Got videos of when your lifts went well and when they were going shit?

How much weight are you gaining on a weekly/monthly basis? How tall are you? How much protein are you eating and are you consistently tracking your food intake? 

Do you have symptoms associated with low test other than not gaining a lot of muscle/strength? Is this actually hindering your life or is it just a value that you found to be in the low range on random?"
powerlifting,"It looks like a great app, but it just doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm trying to put my 5rms in for gzclp and when I press finish it takes me to a blank screen"
powerlifting,"The app is smooth and features a lot of cool programs, shared it with some friends, thanks! 

If I may add some suggestions, based on the my experience with the app I'm used to - Perseus (not all suggestions are actual features, some are stuff I wish they add haha) 

* Have a ""bar weight"" property to each exercise, with default 20kg/45# - since SSB/Logs etc can be of different weight

-  Clicking on the weight of a set during the workout to show the per-side weight - instead of typing it (possibly with a checkbox property to exercises to indicate if it'll won't be loaded on only 1 side like cable/machine work as well as Landmine) 

* Clicking on an exercise during a workout, or in history, allows to switch the exercise (would be useful if for example dealing with an injury and would like to sub an exercise for another that doesn't irritate it, but keep track of progress of this one as well) 

- Tab to create warmup types (like a number of sets with percentage of first set, or start weight with weight jumps, etc) with exercise property to select an existing warmup type

*  Tab to create ""increment scheme"" like double progression (start reps, target reps, and weight increment after reaching target reps), triple progression (same but with start sets and target sets, that add sets after reaching target reps until hitting target sets, then add weight and reset), etc... 

- Ability to pre-customize/build/duplicate a template (ie not on the fly during the workout only), whether from existing programs or an empty one, with option to have exercises be either weight or percentage or time base, as well as selecting an increment-progression (that include both custom and pre-existing increment schemes from the app templates like T1 GZCL, or T2 Nsuns, etc)

I know the last one is a pretty lengthy feature to add, and might be against your goal, especially for beginners who will have the ability to change an already working program (although you could add a notice about not recommending that haha) 

But it'll be a nice feature for more experienced lifters, and people who'd like to do something a bit unconventional like conjugate or following hybrid templates (mixing 2 or more of bodybuilding, strongman, bodyweight, etc)"
powerlifting,I love your app but one thing I'm getting annoyed by is its slow and gets buggy a lot. I love how easy to use and it works great when it doesn't bug out
powerlifting,"Thanks, yeah maybe I‚Äôm just trying to simplify it more, footballs almost done so that‚Äôll be out of the question soon. Thanks for your help, I just need to plan it out the day before"
powerlifting,"When I played HS football I basically ate double portions at nearly every meal plus drank a half gallon of chocolate milk a day and I still lost weight during the season. I guess I'm confused by your question. Just eat more. If you hit your protein targets and you don't feel like shit during your workouts, eat whatever you want to get up to that calorie number. If you do feel like shit you may need to up your carb intake, especially simple carbs right before the workout.


Also, triple decker PBJ is an easy meal that packs a big calorie punch and balances fats, carbs, and proteins fairly well."
powerlifting,Just learn to count dude
powerlifting,Sheiko Gold has a plate calculator built in fyi
powerlifting,"Don't expect to hit your target without a few ""dirty"" foods. Liquid calories, like fruit juice and chocolate milk, won't fill you up much. Otherwise, never miss a chance to add butter or oil to your food."
powerlifting,"A very weird suggestion, but my idiot brain would love a way to calculate weight by plates instead of the actual weight. So instead of entertaining, say, 275 LBS I could enter Bar+ 4 45 plates and 2 25 plates. I always forget what I did last time when working out, being told what plates to put on would be a godsend. Or at least a way to calculate based on the weight entered what plates to start the workout with.

You've already made the best workout app I've ever used, this addition would seriously make it perfect for me."
powerlifting,"Spend like 6 months gaining muscle and doing a basic monthly periodization.  Like for example 5x5 @ 75% on week 1, 5x3 @ 80% on week 2, 3x3 @ 85% on week 3, and 2-3x1 @ 90% on week 4.  Add 10 lbs to these numbers and repeat for the following month. 

Outside of this basic progression, just do your accessories as if you are a bodybuilder. John Meadows and Mike Israetel have great content on YouTube to Make sure you are actually doing accessories correctly for growth.

Eat enough to gain a lb. a week. Some guys are freaks at 165, but most of us aren't. I was a soft 196 at my last meet, but put 220 lbs on my total vs when I was 175.  I'm now a leaner 200, and have put another 200 lbs on my total, albeit in the gym and not a meet. But my openers at my next meet will be PRs.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this, but all these fucking programs that are suggested here are good for peaking/dialing in your top end strength while staying at a certain body weight. For most of us, they just aren't going to build strength in the long run.  

Ask yourself this, do you look like you lift big weights?  Again, some of these guys are gifted at the sport and can put up big totals looking like 150 lb twinks, but for most of us, getting muscular is going to do it. There's a reason amateur bodybuilders can bench more than non-elite powerlifters, even though they do it with no intent one a week, vs 4x a week benching.

Just my 2 cents, worked for me."
powerlifting,"If it's not a lift in competition that got white lights, I honestly don't care"
powerlifting,Let the great water cut headache commence
powerlifting,"So nSuns and GZCLP are still on our old legacy format, which doesn‚Äôt have a lot of functionalities of the newer programs, including restart program. We‚Äôre in the process of migrating these last 2 to the new infrastructure, but until that‚Äôs finished there is no restart program feature for nSuns unfortunately. 

This was super annoying to me as a user but unfortunately was a technical debt that we incurred which has been a major brain damage."
powerlifting,"I‚Äôve been using the app for about a year and love it! My one question is is there a way to archive or ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù a program instead of just deleting program?

E.g. I did 11 weeks of nsuns and it seems to just keep creating a new week and won‚Äôt clear from the home dashboard but I don‚Äôt want to delete the program."
powerlifting,"I use the 2200 base calorie for a man with no exercise and add 200 cals for weightlifting, 1000 cals for football, and 600 cals for the bulk"
powerlifting,"Thanks for your reply!

- form is actually the only thing i can say i am happy about my lifts. i have filmed my lifts from every angle and use good form with plenty of feedback from other powerlifters. 

- i would rank my recovery at **average**. as in, i get enough sleep most nights (even have done multiple sleep studies) although I have slight sleep apnea. I could eat more for sure, but have been still gaining weight and like to gain slowly. I normally take a deload week about every 2 months. 

- honestly, i'm not sure. i even used the same program i used to get to 305 initially. I just have been feeling weaker and weaker every workout with no explanation

- yes I have gotten my bloodwork done quite a few times over the last 5-6 years and it has always come back with low results (low 300s ng/dl). unfortunately, in Canada it is basically impossible to get treatment for this, I have tried 2 endocrinologists as well as about 5 TRT clinics, I was rejected by all due to a combination of young age and having levels that were not under the ""normal"" range. 

This is why I am just so incredibly discouraged right now. because unlike a lot of people who question why they can't progress, I have actually spent years making sure all aspects of my life were at good enough levels that I would not have an excuse to not be making gains."
powerlifting,"&gt;What's your age, height and current weight? Also, do you track your caloric expenditure using an activity tracker and/or heart rate monitor? All of these factors will play a role in answering your question!"
powerlifting,"A few things:

* Post form checks. Maybe something's up with your technique.
* How's your recovery? Are you sleeping enough? Eating right? Taking the occasional deload week? 
* What happened between you squatting 305 and now when you say you can only get 245? 
* You say you've got low T; did you get a complete blood panel done or just test? If everything else in your life is truly on point, I'd get some thorough blood work done. Also, depending on how low your test actually is, maybe it's time for TRT. Talk to your doctor."
powerlifting,"Well i'm an eddie fan but i also have the sense to acknowledge that thor is the superior strength athlete. He has won more titles and holds more records. His ventures into powerlifting also adds onto his accomplishments as a 'strength athlete', no matter what Eddie says he can do in powerlifting. I've slowly tapered off Eddie's content over the years - they're slowly regressing into silly Youtube antics and less strength"
powerlifting,"##I am in DESPERATE need of help. 

I am 27 years old, I've been training for 5 years consistently, I mean consistently, never missed a single workout. I've ran programs such as Candito 6 week, TSA 9 week, Jacked and Tan 2.0, the Rippler, and a couple of others. I cannot progress. 2 years ago I hit a 260 lb squat and through covid got to 305 lbs. Since then I have degraded and now can only squat 245. My bench has been stuck at 225 lbs forever. My deadlift at 345. I am slowing gaining weight and right now am at 160 lbs. I cannot for the life of me make progress. I train hard and put in so much effort and see kids 10 years younger than me making more progress in 6 months than I have in 5 years. What am I doing wrong? Can anyone recommend me a program? I am literally losing my mind, I love lifting but I am genuinely ready to quit and it brings me to tears thinking of all the effort I put in to basically get weaker year after year."
powerlifting,"it might be the angle of the camera, but from what i think you may prob need are wider knee/toe angles. not like, spreading out your feet, but wider. which would naturally call for wider stance. also lower hip starting position, to use more  glute and less your back/lower back. if your mobility/hip flexor is a limiting factor, you prob need to just keep at it and intentionally stretch them out throughout your workout sesh using weights. by opening your ‚Äúhips‚Äù by doing so, you are able to have your hips closer to the bar, which leads to more upright torso‚Ä¶ hence less lower back, more glutes/quads. but it all depends on a person and how they adjust to new weights and continue developing. so, as far as that goes, i dont see any redflags. nice lifts!"
powerlifting,By scummy I mean I washed them 0 times which in hindsight was a mistake. They held up fine though; I still have 'em around just in case I lose my not-greasy pair.
powerlifting,"thoughts on this instagram DL 725 puller? I am not trying to put a shame / praise, just asking for opinions. like, that would pass with three whites, yeah-ish? other than the straps? what are your thoughts‚Ä¶

powerlifting,"The stuff it gives you should be based on the questionnaire I think.

I got a lot of SSB squats in my programming (I assume) because I said my squat weakness was ""rounding over"".

Bridge and Hypertrophy blocks are going to be more focused on variants (especially disadvantaged variants with longer ROM) and accessories and even some strongman types stuff. Strength blocks will focus more on comp lifts (although not entirely) and then Peaking blocks are almost exclusively comp lifts with a bit of accessory work sprinkled in.

That was the experience I had anyway.

I really liked not comp squatting every day because that shit kills my shoulders.

I really did *not* like not doing comp DLs frequently because it kept giving me halting conventional DLs, which are absolutely brutal and made me want to die."
powerlifting,"Your starting position looks pretty low, it looks like you are mixing the upper body position of sumo with the lower body position of conventional. Check out Alan Thrall's how to deadlift video on Youtube for proper set up."
powerlifting,"I like ""long arms"" as a cue to try and communicate it.  
Alan Thrall has a vid where he uses ""shoulders down""  
But ""the slack"" refers to your whole system,,imo.  
I actually call it the pre pull.  
Even on a stiff bar you can see it bend a little.  
Easyier to see the sleeves bend down actually.  
You are taking a not negligable portion of the weight before you even start the main pull.  
Then when you do start the pull, you actually start moving the weight and not just pull the slack out of your body, then start moving the bar.  
I do the pre pull as i drop my hips, so there isn't really much of a pause before the main pull  
[https://streamable.com/xhplup](https://streamable.com/xhplup)  
That's just my take on conventional though."
powerlifting,"That's really interesting, I've been training ~8y and have always comp squatted at least 2-3x week so not seeing it at all was strange and I subbed out a day of variation soi could do it. I guess the flexibility is nice and maybe it's not so bad to take a break from comp technique when my next meet is in May 23. I'm trying to give it a chance. So far today the volume on an sbd day was really intense and I'm very sore"
powerlifting,"Looking for tips on my sumo starting position.
[150KG Paused x2.](https://streamable.com/qqinsq) Not sure how else I should be pulling but it certainly doesn‚Äôt look like the best form to me and I just want to iron it out."
powerlifting,Lol i thought u were aiming for a 500kg pull‚ò†Ô∏è
powerlifting,Sweet - lmk if you guys have any feedback
powerlifting,That‚Äôs a good idea! Will add that to the list of features
powerlifting,"I've been running JuggernautAI for about 8 months.

Ran it in Powerlifting mode for ~30 weeks going into a meet a few weeks ago, now I'm in a Bridge block.

In my first 8 weeks, in a hypertrophy block, I did not do a single comp squat or deadlift. It was all SSB squats, front squats, deficit DLs, and halting DLs. The only comp bench was light technique sets, the main work was Spoto presses and feet up bench.

I don't think I've ever had accessories before main lifts though."
powerlifting,"I‚Äôm a football player trying to gain weight. My football season is almost over (probably this week) I try to eat 4000 cals 230 grams of protein 400 carbs and 130 grams of fat. My struggle is cals, and not protein. I hit my protein goal with 2500 cals. What should I do/ advice"
powerlifting,Just downloaded it! I‚Äôll suggest it to the gym peeps!
powerlifting,"Just downloaded the app and it looks great. I'm going to start using this. However, I would l would like to see a tab where I could look at programs that I have book marked or started."
powerlifting,"I did. My weakest lift, my bench, went up 15lbs. I was very happy with that."
powerlifting,"Im getting notifications for new comments, but I can‚Äôt see them. Is this a bug? Sorry if I can‚Äôt respond"
powerlifting,"Nice work, mate! Sure it‚Äôs not breaking any records but it‚Äôs your first ever comp and you didn‚Äôt bomb out! So glad you enjoyed it and are enthusiastic to keep at it. I think with how passionate you‚Äôve been there‚Äôs no doubt you‚Äôll hit 500 in no time! 

I‚Äôve been aiming for 322.5 in December üòÇ so now I‚Äôve just got even more motivation to go that little bit further. Do I know you? Nope. Are we in the same class or category? Nope. Am I gonna compete with you in my own head for no good reason other than I enjoy seeing you post? Absolutely!!"
powerlifting,"As if I needed *another* reason to buy ice cream... I genuinely don‚Äôt even need these and I‚Äôm gonna make them anyway JUST IN CASE future me does. Can never be too prepared, or have too much ice cream üëÄ"
powerlifting,325. Bare in mind I failed my 2nd squat so my 3rd attempt was my 2nd attempt weight. Bench was also very light because me and my coach agreed we wanted to err on the side of caution because my pauses weren't the best. Also dead was like rpe 9 ngl. 117.5 60 147.5
powerlifting,"Time for you to fucking sparkle, Peachy.

What did you hit the other day?"
powerlifting,"That means a lot, truly. We started as a small side project on Reddit, and I wouldn't be able to build Boostcamp full-time without great supporters like yourself. Thank you!"
powerlifting,Thank you so much! Did you make some solid progress?
powerlifting,"Whatever you choose, good luck in 6.5 weeks!! Even if you choose to bulk and regret it for any reason, you could always come back down to 60kg - possibly stronger than ever"
powerlifting,"I downloaded it and did 8 weeks of nSuns. Amazing app, and thank you for everything you and the team do."
powerlifting,"Could you explain your cue abit more I‚Äôm really interested in that, always looking for a better way to perform deadlifting"
powerlifting,"A7 has ""stiff"" and regular knee sleeves and the regular ones seem to be rated not so great. I have the stiff ones and like them, but I'm also not a knee sleeve connoisseur. 

Alternative - get knee sleeves that don't match the fit but carry so much clout that it doesn't matter (i.e., the Inzer ErgoPros)."
powerlifting,I recommend this app to everyone; I absolutely love it! You‚Äôve done amazing work and I can‚Äôt thank you enough.
powerlifting,"I also have those, I've had em for maybe 3 or 4 years and they're basically good as new. I don't use them super often these days, but they're definitely built to last. 

They are definitely much stiffer than the no-name wraps I had previously, probably stiffer than I'd prefer honestly, but nothing outrageous."
powerlifting,"I think the shift on how people post and share their content has had some impact. Once we had lots of blog posts, web-articles and youtube videos available, but these days a lot of information seems to be presented and consumed in a more compacted form via instagram/reels/stories/tiktok, and that just doesn't seem to get shared here as much.

Maybe there's been a shift in the user base as well because it seems less people are sharing things in general."
powerlifting,"You do want tension on the glutes and pushing toward the back part of your feet, so that's correct. If this also helps get tension in your back then it covers your bases.

Ultimately, cues are simply there to get you to move in the most ideal way possible. Even if the cue is wrong, if it somehow accomplishes the goal of getting you to do the right thing, then it's fine. All that said, it sounds like thar cue is working for you."
powerlifting,Coach got me hype told me to aim for 500kg on my next comp god I love that man
powerlifting,That‚Äôs fair and i do think it‚Äôs cut down on the low effort garbage posts but maybe it‚Äôs gone too far in the other direction. Or maybe there just isn‚Äôt that much to discuss and people don‚Äôt really care about the ‚Äúbig time‚Äù comps. Probably the latter tbh
powerlifting,"We didn't change to rules **specifically to limit posts**. We just tightened up post content rules so this sub doesn't become a messy free-for-all like r/gym that is full of generic beginner questions and other bullshit. The foal was to limit front page content to higher quality, powerlifting-specific content."
powerlifting,"No worries sir. It's not a big deal at all, I was just curious."
powerlifting,I personally do not rate the A7 sleeves very highly.
powerlifting,SBD stiffs are still the best wrap I've ever used. I also highly rate Titan Signature Golds and THPs.
powerlifting,"For me, after my first kid, I ended up right back where I was pre-baby. Won‚Äôt mention the timeline because it‚Äôs not important - timeline will be different for everyone. I feel like the important thing to know is that if you want to, you‚Äôll come back to where you were before baby, and then be able to continue to progress. There will just be some amount of time in between :)

I really strongly feel like the best expectation for a new mom to have, is to not have any expectations on the timeline of returning to pre-baby strength"
powerlifting,"I could never do it myself, but I don't hold it against others who do it for specific reasons like an easy qualifier for a bigger meet."
powerlifting,"I will try to get onto this today.

As I've mentioned before, updating flairs can get a little behind because it's a task that requires a bit of time and can't just be done on an app, which is how we mostly monitor the sub."
powerlifting,"It's not uncommon, and allowed in comps too I'm pretty sure."
powerlifting,"Find something (maybe icecream?) that comes in a large round plastic tub and once you've eaten all the icebreaker, cut shin-guards out of it to stick down the front of your deadlift socks."
powerlifting,"I used to hate squats and I still hate squats, even though they're the lift that's progressing the most consistently right now.

I hate squats so much that I have already mapped out a plan to quit squatting once I hit some goals."
powerlifting,"Well I mean kind of like pulling with straight arms so I feel like my feet are having to push the floor away if that makes sense there‚Äôs tension,
Even when I do it without a bar ( if that makes sense) it feels like when I pull (like a mini pull) or pulling against the bar I instantly feel the tension on my glutes and heels is this right?"
powerlifting,I like my Inzer and Iron Rebel ones. I like stiff üòã though
powerlifting,"I think it depends on how this program starts. If it is quite a reduction from the last few weeks in volume and/or intensity, then you might be fine going right into it. If, on the other hand, it is pretty high volume at a high-ish percent (greater than 75% average intensity perhaps) then a deload would probably be advised."
powerlifting,"It's slightly more than just pulling on the bar. You want to pull the bar by engaging your lats back and down (think lats in the back pockets) at the same time. I have had a lot of success cueing ""row the bar with straight arms"". 

The issue with just pulling is that you won't necessarily get your back set and tight and possibly end up using your biceps to pull the bar. This will possibly lead to the wonderful situation of jacking your back up and tearing a biceps."
powerlifting,"[More Female Strength](https://morefemalestrength.libsyn.com/) hasn't been releasing episodes that often, but I really enjoy the hosts. Also [Barbell Medicine](https://soundcloud.com/user-344313169)."
powerlifting,"It's different for everyone, but speaking for myself: it took about a year to get back to where I was before pregnancy, but I eventually started hitting PR's again. Most noticeable difference for me is in the [pelvic floor](https://morefemalestrength.libsyn.com/020-stress-incontinence-with-lifting)."
powerlifting,"I do it to get points for a series, don't want to go all out for 4-8 meets a year. Bench only meets I almost always go to fail though."
powerlifting,"I used to hate squats, but once I started taking prep seriously my gains have gone crazy. I just hit a pr of 250kg and am slowly falling in love with them. Now deadlifts feel like the girl upset while I watch squats walk by meme."
powerlifting,I would laugh my ass off if I saw that in person....and then go home and cry over my bruised and bloody shins
powerlifting,Deadlift/soccer socks not enough?
powerlifting,"It‚Äôs actually not hard conceptually to lose weight and gain muscle. To lose weight you need to be in a caloric deficit, to gain muscle you need to eat a lot - and do a good lifting program.

So you have to do both. Let‚Äôs assume you want to lose ~1lb of fat a week (some of this may be negated by muscle gain) - that comes out to needing a 500 calorie per day deficit (it takes ~3500 calories to burn 1lb of fat). If your BMR is 2000 calories you just need net calories for the day to equate to 1500. If you want to build muscle, one thing you could do is eat say, 3000-3500 calories a day. You‚Äôd then in turn need to burn 1500-2000 via your daily workouts.

This is effectively how I lost 12lbs while gaining an inch in my chest, shoulders and arms (losing a couple inches in my gut).

The difficulty in this method is that it‚Äôs hard (and expensive) to eat that much and not each junk. For one meal, my goal was to consume close to 1500 calories, with another 1500 between two other meals. The meal size varied based on my workout schedule."
powerlifting,"I wear the stiffs for heavy singles, which is usually 90% and up, and wear my flexible when I get to around 75 or 80%, on bench. I might use the flexibles for OHP if I‚Äôm getting really fatigued, and I use them for squats."
powerlifting,Damn so they held up for nearly 5 years? Or when you say scummy is that them falling apart?
powerlifting,Check out Canadian Powerlifting Podcast! They talk to some female powerlifters
powerlifting,"Yeah I don‚Äôt wear wraps for literally anything other than bench, and very rarely OHP when I program it into my training. 

I‚Äôve heard some people say that they only ever wear the stiff sbd wrist wraps for comps or lifts above 90%, is that the same for you or?"
powerlifting,"Finally got a 160lb bench PR today!! I've been struggling there for weeks, but it came up super easy. 

I also almost got a 170lb bench, but not quite. I dropped the bar down super low on my chest. Once my spotter kinda pushed it higher up my chest, I had the strength to get it up. Hopefully I can get it myself soon!

26F, 150lb bw"
powerlifting,"Not denying that it's goofy, but plastic will protect your skin more than a pair of trousers will."
powerlifting,"In a conventional deadlift is simply pulling on the bar the way to take the slack out of it? 
I‚Äôve been cueing chest up
So if I simply forget that one - would pulling on the bar and then pushing through my heels be okay?"
powerlifting,Lmao da fuq is that...why not just wear pants lol
powerlifting,"A guy at my gym cuts out the sides of two liter soda bottles, puts tape around the edges so it doesn't cut him, and stuffs them into his socks."
powerlifting,"Bought a pair in 2017, let them get too scummy so bought a replacement about a year ago."
powerlifting,"Not exactly *shin* sleeves, but I have a pair of Hookgrip cloth knee sleeves (popular in weightlifting) that serve the purpose very well. Cheap, portable, nice alternative to neoprene sleeves if you don't want a hassle on leg accessories, and they keep the shins nice and lightly cushioned when moved down the leg."
powerlifting,"I have the medium flexibles and long stiffs from SBD. The flexible ones are, well, flexible, in the sense that they are usable for all sorts of things where you might want to wrap your wrists. The stiff ones are good for heavy bench, and that's it."
powerlifting,"I just purchased some sbd knee sleeves after running through 2 pairs of off brand ones I found on Amazon in the space of 2 years. I can‚Äôt wait to finally try some proper sleeves. Also just purchased an SBD belt after outgrowing my current strength shop belt. I was lucky enough to speak to someone the other week who owned an sbd belt and he showed me it and I fell in love with it instantly, the fact you can adjust the belt on the fly rather than having to take the buckle off and move it along and put the buckle back on, saves soo much time."
powerlifting,LiftingCast does this for you. You don‚Äôt have to run a sanctioned meet to use it.
powerlifting,Anyone have recommendations for shin sleeve type products to stop bruising or bleeding when deadlifting? Asking for a friend.
powerlifting,If it‚Äôs an android app you can download bluestacks which is an android emulator and stream that
powerlifting,"No, but do have their sleeves and they also rock."
powerlifting,Have you tried the SBD‚Äôs by any chance?
powerlifting,"Q: Transitioning from one program to another:  
I'm towards the end of the taper week of Layne Northon's PH3 program now, and I've got a full mock meet coming up tomorrow. After this I'm planning to run a specialization program for my deadlifts because they're my weakest out of the big 3 by far. Should I run a deload before hopping on this program, or will it be unnecessary given the taper week I've just run? I'm feeling stronger than ever, with remotely no fatigue at all."
powerlifting,Are you streaming it and is there commentary?
powerlifting,"I've been on it for months and never done a comp squat or deadlift. It's been high bar squats, high bar pause squats, and deficit deadlifts only. I'm almost done with the hypertrophy block and will be moving into strength so hopefully I get to pull off flat ground again soon.  I have been doing feet up and comp bench though"
powerlifting,Has anyone gotten the mods to update their flair lately? I've messaged them after both of my recent meets and have heard nothing.
powerlifting,"Sorry, I don't have an answer for this but I believe most meets use either liftingcast or openlifter, any reason you don't want to use one of those?"
powerlifting,"Stiff, but they aren‚Äôt too much and produce a tight cast while feeling comfortable."
powerlifting,"I like the A7‚Äôs a lot, the fact they have a medium option seems really appealing as I don‚Äôt know whether I want stiff or flexible and this is the only brand I‚Äôve seen offer a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù. 

Can I ask which you chose? Stiff, medium or flex?"
powerlifting,"if you're new and changing/trying out a lot of technique things week to week, trying new cues, etc., it can mess with where you start (hip height). To fix it, just start the hips a little higher with more hamstring stretch and see how it feels and looks until you're comfortable. Right now you aren't able to find the most powerful position for your body to brace and hinge until you start the lift - with practice you'll start there"
powerlifting,"If you have a Windows machine, you could use Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) and run the app that way."
powerlifting,Have A7s and they seem like they will last forever.
powerlifting,"Imagine training for six months for a meet and not maxing out. I could never.

Caveat: like someone else said, unless it‚Äôs being used as a qualifier or someone‚Äôs playing it safe to win."
powerlifting,"The only time it‚Äôd be there is for a bridge block or powerbuilding, as far as I can think of.

Comp squat may not be in there until a strength block. You‚Äôre free to change that though."
powerlifting,"probably because this reddit is pretty bad.    You see topics with 20+  replies being deleted, people obviously want to talk about something and it just gets deleted because practically everything is supposed to go in the daily.  So in addition to genuine hot topics getting canned, the same shit gets asked over and over because no one ever reads old dailies. and the questions in the dailies don't come up in searches.    
There used to be good powerlifting forums out there, I think people just don't use forums and message boards as much anymore in general."
powerlifting,I dont care if its real or not? But they Both use it as a marketing tool and that would make this a bad move for Eddie
powerlifting,You should check out The Power in Lifting podcast w Solana Lewis and The Strength Academy w Kristin Lander and Jen Thompson.

powerlifting,"Yes. And by heavy, I don‚Äôt mean something that you‚Äôll struggle or grind with. It can be an RPE 6 single. Just something to keep you comfortable with relatively heavy loading on your back."
powerlifting,"I hit a 5kg pr on my squat 5 yesterday (225kg) and today feel like I was hit by a car lol. Been awhile since I've really had to grind a squat.

powerlifting,Do people like you actually think that the beef between them is real?
powerlifting,How long have you had these for?
powerlifting,"Ah sorry for the confusion. What I meant was that as part of a training block, the last workout is an AMRAP, and 13x135kg made me think that 3x150kg would feel easier than it did. 

Are you saying that you'd do a single heavy rep in a volume phase, followed by the volume work to keep your body conditioned to heavy weights?"
powerlifting,I've sized down on mine and used them for some 5? months now and they look brand new. Might've been a QC issue or something else going on. Maybe they used them as shin protectors on deadlifts and scraped them with knurling? That's the only thing I could imagine.
powerlifting,"I kinda fixed my squat but now my deadlift is a little weird, my hips are rising up like an inch or so before the bar clears the ground when that has never happened in the past... Any thoughts?

bench seems to be getting better though!

powerlifting,"I've never tried a wrist wrap that hurt, but I've never tried SBDs. For a stiff option I like [these](https://www.liftinglarge.com/thp-powerlifting-wrist-wraps), but I've not tried a ton of different ones so don't take that as gospel."
powerlifting,I'm really curious about how things changed after having a kid.  I'm making plans to start trying but I'm trying to prepare myself for how it'll change my favorite hobby.
powerlifting,"Any good podcasts recommendations? I like Dave Rate‚Äôs table talk but I have listened to most of them.

Bonus points if they feature a lot of female athletes. There are some good episodes with Massenomics and Mark Bell‚Äôs podcasts but both of them are a bit too goofy for my liking."
powerlifting,"Unfortunately I‚Äôm gymbroless, and yeah I feel if I go into it blind I‚Äôm probably gonna pick wrong, that‚Äôs why I wanna take the best blind guess I can. I don‚Äôt even get how all these companies make such different wraps from one another‚Ä¶ I like the sound of the sbd stiff wraps, that‚Äôs probably what I‚Äôll get unless persuaded otherwise‚Ä¶ my main concern with the sbd that‚Äôs putting me off is that I‚Äôve read soo many people say that because the sbd ones are soo thick they hurt more than usual, but at the end of the day I don‚Äôt know how painful that painful is because I‚Äôve never tried them. Be good if I could have something to compare the pain to"
powerlifting,Yea that's a fair point
powerlifting,"&gt; One sized down and they disintegrated

Use shit incorrectly, expect to fail in a different way than the manufacturer suggests."
powerlifting,I've just been ignoring the exercise order and doing closed-chain compounds first from most to least likely to be taxing. Hasn't created any issues as far as I can tell.
powerlifting,"I just‚Ä¶ this.

I‚Äôve been wondering if it was just me, but I have a special sensitivity towards narcissism because I was raised by a narcissist. But it seems like egos are flaring right now."
powerlifting,If you've got some gym buddies who will let you try theirs out that's a good start. I haven't tried a huge variety of wraps but there's enough difference between the ones I've tried that going into it blind I could've ended up with something I hated.
powerlifting,"Yeah, I was referring to the bone-headedly easy (theoretically easy not easy in practice) where you just chug along in a set rep range, but more spaced out etc. I'll definitely check out Calgary Barbell, maybe I'll glance at the lower body days in Candito's 6 week program again."
powerlifting,I've just heard from friends. One sized down and they disintegrated and the other said he had to replace them every 3 months
powerlifting,"I hit 85% for my openers and I feel like I was letting everyone down. Even the announcer said ""went a bit light there...."" 

85%/92.5%/Goal will still be my strategy for future meets though."
powerlifting,"&gt;Going to a meet and hitting RPE 7 lifts is pretty meh.

i just went to a comp and did this exactly pahaha. my last squat and bench id say were a 7. I failed 2nd squat so stayed with that weight and it was easy (failed because of depth. dont ask me how i dont know ive easily hit depth with that weight before). Bench was rpe7 too and me and my coach both agreed my pauses were not stable enough if they were going to be like 2 or 3 second pauses so figured to play it safe for the first comp and work on it for the second. dead was rpe9 also but that suprised me cause it was a 7.5kg pb"
powerlifting,"I've never heard anyone say anything bad about A7 knee sleeves and I've been looking way too much prior to purchase. What did you hear?

They feel the same to a pair of SBD sleeves that I tried."
powerlifting,"Got it. I was confused because you said you went from a set of 13 to the sets of 3's only 4 weeks later.

For what it's worth, I can still see where you're going to feel unready for the heavy loads you'd go with for 3's given this periodization scheme. This is where the value comes from having a 'top single @6-8' prior to the working sets on any of these blocks -  be it 10's, 8's, 5's or 3's. You get that exposure to the heavier loads, which on squats feels A LOT different than lighter loads you can use for 8's or 10's, or really even 5's."
powerlifting,Oh are they not? I've only heard bad things about them. This is good news for me
powerlifting,"I agree that‚Äôs not the most fun to watch but if the goal is qualify for another event and don‚Äôt mess up by getting too fancy, I can‚Äôt argue with that reasoning."
powerlifting,They're not?
powerlifting,"Good shit, man!"
powerlifting,"Think you misunderstood: it's basically 4 weeks of 10s, then 4 weeks of 8s, and so forth. Its not 10s and 3s in one workout."
powerlifting,Have you read Manufacturing Consent?
powerlifting,"Unpopular opinion:

Going to a meet and hitting RPE 7 lifts is pretty meh.

(Caveat: do whatever you wanna do)"
powerlifting,"Just making sure I understand what you mean by linear progression in this context - are you talking about working within one rep range and increasing the load a little bit weekly with like starting strength or strong lifts? If so, I think that's a bad idea (especially bad during a time when you're busy and your recovery might not be very good). You can't really just *force* training adaptations like that as a non-beginner. There are other/better progression schemes.

If 1-on-1 coaching isn't financially feasible for you right now, there are a lot of good, proven programs/templates out there that you could run for a long time with some small modifications as needed. I would recommend looking into Barbell Medicine, Calgary Barbell, RTS, and Stronger by Science - they all have good options for free or &lt;$50. Other people in this sub might have some other recommendations, too. I'm sure you could find something that fits your schedule and goals."
powerlifting,"Yup, you can."
powerlifting,"just so people know, if you‚Äôre a fan of Matt Wenning and want to buy his manuals, he gives most of them away for free on his patreon in the World Class tier. i got it because that tier gives you 25% of the manuals, bought several of them, and then only to find several of them being given away for free so i could‚Äôve saved like $100-150 worth if i would‚Äôve just went through his entire patreon first (which i still have a year and a half worth of content left to go through)"
powerlifting,"I should do that. Got some sort of an imposter syndrome I guess. Dudes that are (/used to be) stronger than me didn't complain, so neither should I, which is a silly thing to think, I know."
powerlifting,"Moreover, even if he wanted to shoot for 200kg, you cannot be thinking like this. Have to approach the bar with the intent to move the weight, zero doubts."
powerlifting,"The higher percentage of your one-rep max loads used on 3‚Äôs feel very different than the loads you would use for 10‚Äôs and 8‚Äôs. Would not recommend programming a block like this. On any particular day of the training week, you should be working in the same rep range (also number of sets) within a block. Otherwise, how are you comparing performance from week to week? Such a massive difference from 10‚Äôs to 3‚Äôs, or even 8‚Äôs to 3‚Äôs."
powerlifting,"I‚Äôd like to pay around ¬£30, and I care most about quality not the logo. Also stoic are ¬£35 and sbd are ¬£30 pound, or when you say SBD are more expensive do you mean more expensive where you are or?  

I‚Äôm not sure whether I want flexible or stiff, I really like the sound of stiff ones when I read what everyone says about them, I don‚Äôt mind a bit of pain, my worries were things like I‚Äôve read a few people complain that the wrist wraps become loose and fall down there wrists, maybe because they‚Äôre harder to get a tight wrap I‚Äôm unsure as I‚Äôve never owned stiff ones only flexible. My complaint with flexible is that my hands go numb."
powerlifting,"Eddie without a suit hasnt ever pulled over 465 i believe. Eddie without straps i doubt has pulled over 400. His ego and his fanboys wouldnt be able to cope with that.

All it would to for him is cement hafthors place as the superior strength athlete, and thats terrible for his brand."
powerlifting,I used it for a brief amount of time. I think if I remember correctly if you're in a hypertrophy or offseason block it will give you accessories before the comp lifts sometimes but it was normally just some back work. I really enjoyed the sheiko AI over the jugg AI having ran both but ymmv
powerlifting,"Go for it, especially if these sources are peer-reviewed."
powerlifting,Is anyone using JuggernautAI for powerlifting? Starting a two week trial and seeing some weirdness in the program like accessories before main lifts and comp squat never actually programmed (i switched out a different squat exercise for comp squat but it was weird to not be in there)
powerlifting,"150kg deadlift done. On my profile, not able to copy paste"
